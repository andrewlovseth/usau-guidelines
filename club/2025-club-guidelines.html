            <li>Major Triple Crown Tour (mTCT) Tournament and requirement acceptances dates have been changed to allow teams more time to decide on their season. See <a href="#team-flight-status">Q. Team Flight Status</a> below for specific acceptance dates.</li>

            <li>Any team ranked in the Top 24 in the 2024 End of Season Rankings must compete in 10 sanctioned games during the 2025 season to be eligible to play the 2025 series. Pro, Elite and Top Select teams require 10 sanctioned games, regardless of ranking.</li>

            <li>2025 mTCT dates have been announced and the 2026 mTCT tentative dates and bid applications are live. <a href="https://usaultimate.org/host-a-championship-event/" target="_blank">See here for additional information</a>.</li>

            <li>Pro Championships may expand to 12 teams in each division based on interest and field availability. Once the initial 8 bids are accepted, another round of invitations may be offered to teams in groups of 4. Four teams must accept to expand the tournament to 12 teams. A division will only expand to 12 teams if all 12 teams were ranked in the top 20 in 2024. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRtxsARbLmFIjNh4ygXySWI6z8_2Fmc3fwHFwr6KgKM/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">Event Requirements and Wait List Criteria (2025 TCT)</a> for more information. </li>

            <li>As in 2024, there will be early season roster flexibility with all players being allowed to switch teams multiple times. Man matching players may do so before June 25th (prior to PEC-E). In 2025, Women Matching players will have roster flexibility through July 30, 2025 (prior to US Open).  See <a href="#season-roster-changes">Season Roster Changes</a>.</li>

            <li>Match play fees continue to be waived for women's division games.</li>

            <li>To accommodate larger sections, sections have been adjusted throughout the country. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17lbfZc__jV_FUMCUEdq_cWZc5l3-CtTjtKDctMSb2YE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">See here for more information</a>.</li>

            <li>The series registration has been pushed up one week earlier, to Friday, August 22, 2025 to accommodate sectionals coordinators organizing events. See additional details in <a href="#postseason">V. Postseason (Championship Series)</a>. As a reminder, if a player will not be attending sectionals but will play with your team for regionals or nationals (if your team earns an invitation), they MUST be on your series roster by the deadline prior to sectionals.</li>

            <li>In addition to the series registration deadline, an initial deposit is due to the appropriate TD by the end of the business day on the Monday following the initial roster deadline (August 25th in 2025) for the postseason.</li>

            <li>The order of Finals for U.S. Open, Pro Championships and Club Nationals has been determined. See <a href="#major-tct-events">R. Major Triple Crown Tour Events</a> for each event's Finals Order.</li>

            <strong>USA Ultimate Triple Crown Tour</strong><br />
            The Triple Crown Tour (TCT) for USA Ultimate's club men's, mixed and women's divisions enters its twelfth season in 2025. TCT teams are divided into four (4) flights based on their performance in the previous year's TCT. Teams in each flight have different season requirements. Teams at all levels are encouraged to participate in the TCT's Regular Season and Postseason. While there are incentives to compete in the regular season, registration will be open to any teams that want to compete in the Postseason Championship Series.

        <h3>B. Spirt of the Game (SOTG)</h3>

        <p>
            Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.
        </p>

        <p>
            All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Teams are expected to have a spirit captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials. Spirit captains should do spirit scoring with their teams after each game and are responsible for the timely submission of spirit scores.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.

            <strong>Major TCT Events</strong> - Event formats, game rules, seeding and the use of Observers will be determined by USA Ultimate. <strong>The “Captains' Clause” (<a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/#1">Rule 1.B.3</a>) does not apply.</strong>

        <h3>D. Definition of a Team</h3>

        <p>
            The following rules will define a team from year to year, for the purpose of determining its flight status and eligibility for competing in the Triple Crown Tour. A team in the same division will be defined primarily by its name and home location (city, state) and the following factors:
        </p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                For consistency between seasons, If a team has at least seven (7) returning players from the previous season (2024), they are considered that same team and are expected to retain the team's name and home location.
            </li>
            <li>
                If two teams have seven (7) or more returning players from one team that participated in the previous season, the team with more returning players will have priority in retaining team name, branding, etc. as well as the team's spot on invitation lists for mTCT events.

            </li>
            <li>
                If a Pro, Elite, or Top Select team is returning the next year, a “new” team in the same division may not have more than seven players from that team's prior year roster in order to be eligible for the postseason.<br />
                <em>An exception may be granted by the appropriate National Director if the new team plays at least 10 regular season games.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                To change either a team's name or its home location and still retain the team's flight status and spot on any mTCT invitation list, the team must present an appeal to the corresponding USA Ultimate National Director describing its rationale. Appeals must be submitted prior to competing.

                <strong>2025 Rules</strong><br />
                All USA Ultimate Regular Season and Postseason Events must use the “2024-2025 Official Rules of Ultimate” which are available at <a href="http://www.usaultimate.org/rules">usaultimate.org/rules</a> in HTML and PDF formats along with <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Substantive-Changes-from-the-2022-2023-Rules.pdf" target="blank" >supporting documentation highlighting and explaining the substantive changes from the 2022-2023 Edition</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>Game Length Minimums</strong><br />
                TCT games should be scheduled to last at least 90 minutes and play to 15 points. All games at sanctioned USA Ultimate events must meet the minimum point and time-based requirements. That is each game must be initially set at minimum to 11 points and 60 minutes in length in order to be an official game. Games under the minimums are subject to USA Ultimate review for inclusion in rankings or game counts.

                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>
                        <strong>NEVER</strong> report an inaccurate score. Doing so will result in game disqualifications and other sanctions to teams, organizers and players

                    <li>
                        If a game is a forfeit (see forfeit rule below), do NOT enter a score. You must inform the TD and report a W/F on the USA Ultimate reporting app.

                    <li>
                        Requests to shorten any game must be approved prior to playing by the event manager/TD and should still meet the minimum requirements mentioned above. Captains may not simply agree to play to a lower number or for a certain amount of time. This will result in consequences for both teams and both captains.

                    <li>
                        Games that are suspended due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reasons will be counted only if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total or half the minimum game length.

        <h3>J. Forfeit Rule</h3>

        <p>
            The competition format of an event and the season as a whole rely on scheduled games being played. As a general rule, USA Ultimate prohibits the forfeiting of scheduled games during the Regular Season. Teams are expected to play out their entire schedule of games at events they have chosen to enter. All teams entering an event should expect that their opponents will play their scheduled games. These rules apply regardless of the caliber of the opponent or the stage of the competition in which a game is scheduled.
        </p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>
                Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field, will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.
            </li>

            <li>
                If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed at a rate of one (1) point per five (5) minutes. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will forfeit the game.
            </li>

            <li>
                A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums, found in <a href="#roster-limits">P. Roster Maximums and Minimums</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Reporting false scores will be treated with significant sanctions. If a game is forfeited, teams must report the forfeiture. If a game is not finished, scores and game length are to be reported as they are. Teams may not manipulate the final score to reach the game minimum. Violating this rule will incur sanctions for both teams involved. See the sanctions section (Item 6 below) for more information.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Exceptions</strong>
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>
                        The safety of athletes is a top priority and must be considered when determining whether a game should be played and under what conditions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Tournament formats and event schedules must fall within the guidelines set forth for sanctioned events and be published at least two (2) business days prior to the event. Impact to teams due to changes with short notice must be considered.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Games that are the last of an event for both teams may be forfeited, provided the tournament director and both teams are in agreement. Games which are forfeited without the TD director approval are subject to sanctions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Sanctions</strong><br />
                 USA Ultimate reserves the right to sanction teams that forfeit games during the regular season. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, disqualification from the regular season and/or series, rankings and/or bid allocation penalties, team and/or player/coach suspensions, financial penalties and team and/or member conduct hearings. Game forfeits will be dealt with on a case by case basis, taking into account all pertinent facts and perspectives.

        <h3>K. Eligibility</h3>

        <p>
            Teams participating in any Regular Season event or game must do so only with players who are on the team's Regular Season roster AND Event Roster for that event or game.

        <h3>L. Season Roster Changes</h3>

        <p>
            For the 2025 season, to allow players and teams the time to host tryouts and establish rosters on a timeline they and their community are comfortable with, man-matching players will have the flexibility to play on multiple rosters from the start of the Regular Season until Tuesday, June 25, 2025. Women-matching players in all divisions will have roster flexibility extended to Tuesday, July 30, 2025. After the June 25th (For Man-Matching Players) or July 30th (for Women Matching Players) cutoff, players may switch rosters but not return to a roster after playing a Regular Season Event with a different team. The intent of this flexibility is to support teams. Use of roster flexibility to manipulate rankings is not allowed and will result in significant sanctions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Man Matching Example:</em> Man Matching (MM) Player A can play with Team X and Team Y interchangeably from the start of the Regular Season until June 25th. If MM Player A attends a Regular Season event with Team X on July 5-6, then an event with Team Y in August, that MM Player may NOT return to play any Regular Season event or the series with Team X. Doing so will result in disqualification from the event, games not counting, and potential suspensions for the Player and Team.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Woman Matching Example:</em> Man Matching (MM) Woman Matching (WM) Player A can play with Team X and Team Y interchangeably from the start of the Regular Season until July 30th. If WM Player A attends a Regular Season event with Team X on August 2-3, then an event with Team Y later  in August, that WM Player may NOT return to play any Regular Season event or the series with Team X. Doing so will result in disqualification from the event, games not counting, and potential suspensions for the Player and Team.

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="geographic-eligibility">
        <h3>M. Geographic Eligibility</h3>

        <p>
            At least 50% of the players on a team's Season Roster must reside in the <strong>section</strong> in which
            that team will compete.
        </p>

        <p>
            At least 75% of the players on a team's Season Roster must reside in the <strong>region</strong> in which
            that team will compete.
        </p>

        <p>
            At least 50% of the players on a team's Postseason Roster must reside in the <strong>section</strong> in which that team will compete.
        </p>

        <p>
            At least 75% of the players on a team's  Postseason Roster must reside in the <strong>region</strong> in which that team will compete.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the above, a team can roster no more than five (5) out-of-region players at any event in which the team will be competing. Additionally, a team may not roster more than seven (7) out-of-region players during the 2025 Season.
        </p>

        <p>“Residence" is defined as meeting <strong>both</strong> of the below criteria:</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>
                Location where the person is living for the majority of September and October, <strong>and</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Location where the person is living for the majority of either the three months prior to September 1 or immediately following October 31.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If the above definition means that a player does not have a region as their “residence,” then the player is considered to be an out-of-region player and counts towards a team's out-of-region limits (maximum of five out-of-region players and no more than 25% of the roster).
        </p>

        <p>
            If a regional boundary divides a metropolitan area, a team based in that metropolitan area may request an exception for players living in that metropolitan area to count as in-region for that team. In order for an exception to be granted, a player and team must establish that the player is part of the local community in which the team is based. In order for teams to be in compliance with the geographic guidelines throughout the season, players must receive exception approval prior to participation with the team at a Regular Season or Postseason event. To request this exception, email your National Director and copy the Manager of Competition and National Team Programs <a href="mailto:clubmanager@usaultimate.org">clubmanager@usaultimate.org</a>.

            Teams that are found to have violated the letter or spirit of the rules mentioned here, or whose behavior undermines the competition structure (e.g. misrepresenting the composition of a team at a specific event, misrepresenting the composition of a team over the course of the season, intentionally playing with ineligible players, intentionally misrepresenting gender for mixed on-field personnel ratio, etc.) will be subject to ramifications as outlined in “Violations and Sanctions.” Roster violations should be reported to the Manager of Competition and National Team Programs at

                <strong>Determining the ratio</strong><br />
                <strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “prescribed ratio” rule (also known as Rule A in the
                official <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/documents/wfdf-rules-of-ultimate-2021-2024-appendix-v1/download" target="blank">WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2022-2024 - APPENDIX v1.0</a >:<br /><br />
                <em>Ratio Rule A (“prescribed ratio” rule):</em><br />
                At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the gender ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “majority pull” rule”<br />
                Each point, a player representing the gender match-up with four players on the field must pull for that point. That is, if there are four women-matching players a woman-matching player must pull.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>For all Mixed games</strong>, if a team cannot match the on-field personnel ratio of all seven players on the team determining the personnel ratio for the point, then it must play with fewer than seven players, but no less than 5, matching the personnel ratio with as many players as possible.
            </li>

                <strong>For all Mixed games -</strong>

                    <li>
                        Personnel Ratio Violation: Violations of the prescribed personnel ratio and how they are handled are described in 2024-2025 Official Rules of Ultimate (9.B.3.a).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the majority pull rule will be handled the same as an offsides violation/false start violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling “offsides,” a player should call “majority pull violation.” Like with offsides violations, after the first majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as described in 9.B.4.d.2. Majority pull rule violations accumulate separately from offsides/false start violations. In games with observers, either the observer or a player on the field may call the violation.

                <strong>Substitutions</strong><br />
                Player substitutions can be completed only:

                    <li>
                        after a goal and before the substituting team has signaled readiness; or

                    <li>
                        to replace injured players, replace players with illegal equipment (7.D.3), to resolve an incorrect personnel violation (9.B.3.a), or to replace a player removed due to misconduct (2.C.2, Appendix B). In this case, the opposing team may substitute a like number of, or fewer, players. In the Mixed Division a substituting player must be of the same gender match as the player they are replacing.

                                2) The opposing team may substitute a like number or fewer players. The gender match of these players does not need to match the sub made by the injured team.<br/>

                        If Gender Match Signaling is to be requested, team and/or spirit captains should discuss and agree to do so during the captains' meeting prior to the start of the game. If teams do not reach agreement, then players should signal gender as described in 6.b. Exception: If it becomes apparent, after the start of the game, that Gender Match Signalling is needed, team and/or spirit captains will need to meet and mutually agree for both sides to begin doing so. [[No player, captain, or coach may make a spur-of-the-moment request for the opposing team to signal their respective gender matches between points.

                    <li>
                        If requested to do so, it is a best practice for players on the receiving team to signal their gender match within 50 seconds after the previous goal was scored for the purpose of allowing the pulling team to match up defensively. [[The pulling team is permitted to remind the receiving team to signal their respective gender matches as long as it was previously agreed upon, per 6a.

                         Individual games may be sanctioned at the discretion of USA Ultimate in order to provide flexibility for teams in planning their seasons and scheduling playing opportunities. Match play sanctioning may require earlier sanctioning application deadlines, will be subject to the review of USA Ultimate staff and may require additional oversight and/or structure to ensure the integrity of the competition, especially in the last three weeks of the regular season. For 2025, sanctioning fees for match play for Women's Division teams will be waived.

        <h3>T. Team Registration Requirements</h3>

        <p>
            All teams that compete in the Regular Season must submit an online Event Roster by the event- specific, rolling deadline (Wednesday prior to event). Teams are required to do the following:
        </p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>
                Notify the event organizer of their intention to compete in the event, acknowledge understanding that the team will be considered a Regular Season team and receive confirmation that the team has received a bid to the event.
            </li>

            <li>
                Once confirmed, use the online rostering system to submit the team's Event Roster for the event.
            </li>

            <li>
                Complete team's Event Roster by 5pm MDT on the <strong>Wednesday prior</strong> to the event.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ensure that USA Ultimate membership dues and individual waivers are submitted by every participant before they are added to an Event Roster. Players must be added to the Event Roster by 5pm MDT on the Wednesday prior to the event in order to participate.
            </li>

            <li>
                Any player found to play in a Regular Season Event without being on a team's Event Roster will face sanctions along with any other culpable parties, including, but not limited to the Team Manager, teammates, other teams and the event organizers. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, ejection from the event, fines and/or suspensions.

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="rankings">
        <h3>U. Rankings</h3>

        <p>
            The Final Regular Season Rankings are used to determine bid allocations for the Postseason. The rankings will be based on games played between eligible teams at Regular Season Events.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Regular Season Rankings algorithm will be run, and the rankings will be published weekly starting July 30, 2025.
        </p>

        <p>
            Teams must compete in a minimum of 10 Regular Season games to be included in the Final Regular Season Rankings, which impact bid allocation to Regionals and Nationals. We encourage teams to utilize match play as a way to compete locally. In the event of uncontrollable circumstances (i.e. weather), USAU Club Manager and National Directors will grant exceptions to the 10 game minimum on a case by case basis.
        </p>

        <p>
            To support roster consistency between the Regular Season and Postseason for Classic and Select Flight teams, at least 50% of a team's Postseason Roster must consist of players that competed for the team during the Regular Season for the team's Regular Season ranking to count in the Postseason bid allocations.            
        </p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>
                Rankings Eligibility<br />
                Regular Season rankings are tentative, pending eligibility verification. At the end of the Regular Season, any eligibility-based adjustments will be made to finalize Regular Season rankings. Results of Regular Season Events or Games will not count if:                

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>The event does not meet the USA Ultimate definition of Ultimate.</li>
                    <li>
                        The competition rules of the event designate the number of players on the field for a team to be any number other than seven.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Games do not meet the minimum point and time-based requirements (each game must have been initially set at minimum to be played to 11 points and at least 60 minutes in length).
                    </li>
                    <li>An inaccurate score is reported.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> Games suspended or modified due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reason may be counted if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total, half cap, or half the minimum game length, at the discretion of USA Ultimate.
        </p>

        <p>
            If a team competes in a Regular Season event with ineligible players, the team will be treated as ineligible and its results will not count for the event. Any eligible opposing team that competes against the ineligible team at the event will receive credit for competing in the game (i.e., game will be included in the team's regular season game count), but the results of the game will not be included in the regular season rankings.
        </p>

        <p>
            USA Ultimate reserves the right to disallow Regular Season results if they are determined not to be in line with the goals of the USA Ultimate Triple Crown Tour or the mission and policies of USA Ultimate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Teams are not allowed to split to add additional teams to an event after the July 1st cutoff. Deliberate misrepresentation of a team registered for the Regular Season in order to influence Regular Season rankings will be considered a roster violation and may be subject to ramifications as outlined in the section titled “Violations and Sanctions.” In addition to those sanctions, if such deliberate misrepresentation of a team is discovered, USA Ultimate reserves the right to assign a game result to whichever team it deems appropriate.

                    In order to participate in the Postseason, teams must be created via the online rostering system or rolled over from a previous year (to roll a team over from 2024 or earlier you may have to roll it over multiple times) and registered for their appropriate Postseason event with a valid Event Roster (10-player minimum) by Friday, August 22 at 5pm MDT. <strong>This date is the same for all teams regardless of flight or byes to Regionals.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is ONE Postseason Roster that is rolled over from Sectionals to Regionals to Nationals depending on team qualification. You CANNOT add players to your Regionals or Nationals event roster after the Postseason Event Roster Deadline (September 3, 2025). <strong>This deadline is the same for all teams, including teams advancing directly to Regionals.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Select and Classic Flight teams must register for their appropriate sectional event.</p>

                <p>
                    Pro and Elite Flight teams that have met their respective requirements to earn a bye to Regionals and intend to advance directly to Regionals must accept their invitation to their regional event by August 22, 2025 (by 5pm MDT/7pm EDT). Otherwise they should contact their National Division Director to decline their bye and register for their appropriate sectional event by the August 22 5pm MDT deadline.
                </p>

                <p>
                     If your sectional event has a player fee and your team has players that will not be attending, but do plan to attend Regionals upon qualification, please discuss with the Tournament Director to ensure accurate charges. ALL players must be on the Postseason Roster before Sectionals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All teams should contact their Sectional or Regional Coordinator before the Team Registration Deadline to confirm their participation in Sectionals. Coordinator contact info can be found on the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">USA Ultimate website</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the purposes of event logistics, tournament directors may work with USA Ultimate coordinators to impose a deadline by which teams must decide whether they will attend the tournament. In addition, an initial deposit is due by the end of the business day on the Monday following the initial roster deadline (August 25th in 2025). Tournament Directors may keep deposit fees from teams that pull out of the tournament Extensions to the deadline may be granted at the sole discretion of the tournament director and sectional coordinator.

If there are an odd number of bids, there will be one more auto bid than strength bids. All sections with at least one team registered for the Postseason will receive at least one auto bid to Regionals. Regional auto bids will be awarded first to the section with the greatest team count based on the Team Registration Deadline. The next bid will be awarded to the section with the second highest team count and so on until all auto bids have been awarded.

                        Seeding for Sectionals and Regionals will be done by the appropriate coordinator using the following information: results prior to the postseason (e.g., head to head, common opponents, etc.) with an emphasis on official regular season rankings. Regular season results, input solicited from all the captains of participating teams, results of the prior year's season, and other applicable information may also be considered.

                        Regionals will additionally be held to the following guideline: no team that finishes ahead of another team at sectionals may be seeded behind that team at regionals.

                        The Nationals Championships will be draw based. Postseason rankings will be published after regionals (October 1, 2025). The teams in each division will be divided into four pots of four. All pots will be determined by each team's Post Regional Rankings, with Pot 1 containing the highest-ranked teams who qualified for Nationals (1-4), Pot 2 containing the next highest-ranked teams who qualified for nationals (5-8), and so on until Pot 4, containing the lowest ranked teams(13-16). The top seeds will be seeded first in Pools A – D based on their post-Regional Ranking. The remaining spots in each pool will be filled with one team from each pot drawn randomly. Three teams from the same region cannot fall into the same pool.

        <h3>W. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>
            Failure to abide by any of the Triple Crown Tour guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate <a href="https://usaultimate.org/conduct/code-of-conduct/">conduct process</a>. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Disqualification may include not only elimination of the team from the current season, but also limitations on participation of players during the remainder of the current season, and limitation on participation of the team (and its players) in subsequent seasons.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to help teams follow Triple Crown Tour guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Triple Crown Tour. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the TCT, many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.
