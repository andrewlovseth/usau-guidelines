            <li>The rankings will continue to follow the same requirements from prior years (10 game minimum to earn series bids).</li>
            <li>International games at the U.S. Open will count towards a teams 10 game minimum, but the results will not be utilized in the rankings.</li>

        <h3>A. Glossary</h3>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li><strong>Triple Crown Tour (TCT)</strong> - The TCT encompasses both the Regular Season and the Postseason for USA Ultimate club teams. The TCT includes Major TCT (mTCT) events run by USA Ultimate and any event which is a Regular Season or Postseason event. Winning the Triple Crown refers to winning the U.S. Open Club Championships, the Pro Championships and the National Championships.</li>

            <li><strong>Regular Season</strong> - All official Regular Season Events or match-play games that occur between the first weekend in June and last weekend in August, with the addition of Labor Day weekend for teams attending the Pro Championship is the Regular Season.

            <li><strong>Regular Season Rankings</strong> - Regular Season games will be factored into the USA Ultimate Regular Season rankings algorithm. Rankings are published weekly starting the last Wednesday in July, with Final Regular Season Rankings posted at the end of the Regular Season. Teams must play a minimum of 10 games to be included in the Final Regular Season Rankings. International games at the U.S. Open will be included in a team's Regular Season game count but will not be included when calculating a team's power rating. Games against International Teams at other events will not count towards Regular Season Rankings.</li>

            <li><strong>Postseason Championship Series</strong> - The national tournament following the regular season comprises geographic-based qualifying events (Sectionals, Regionals) and concludes at the National Championships. Also referred to as the "Postseason" and “Championship Series.” The entirety of the Postseason, including Sectionals, Regionals and Nationals is a single Event.</li>

            <li><strong>National Championships</strong> - The third leg of the Triple Crown and the culminating event of the Postseason and the TCT where the USA Ultimate National Championship winning teams are crowned in the men's, mixed and women's divisions.

        <h3>B. Spirt of the Game (SOTG)</h3>

        <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

        <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount.</p>

        <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

        <h3>C. Competition Authority</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Major TCT Events</strong> - Event formats, game rules, seeding and the use of Observers will be determined by USA Ultimate. <strong>The “Captains' Clause” (<a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/#1">Rule 1.B.3</a>) does not apply.</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>All other Regular Season Events</strong> - Event formats, game rules, seeding and the use of Observers are all at the discretion of the Regular Season Event organizers, provided they meet event guidelines outlined in the USA Ultimate sanctioned-event agreement and in these guidelines as specified within this document.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="definition-of-a-team">
        <h3>D. Definition of a Team</h3>

        <p>The following rules will define a team from year to year, for the purpose of determining its flight status and eligibility for competing in the Triple Crown Tour. A team will be defined primarily by its name and home location (city, state) and the following factors:</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>For consistency between seasons, If a team has at least seven (7) returning players from the previous season (2022), they are considered that same team and are expected to retain the team's name and home location.</li>
            <li>If two teams have seven (7) or more returning players from one team that participated in the previous season, the team with more returning players will have priority in retaining team name, branding, etc. as well as the team's spot on invitation lists for mTCT events.</li>
            <li>
                If a Pro, Elite, or Top Select team is returning the next year, a "new" team in the same division may not have more than seven players from that team's prior year roster in order to be eligible for the postseason.<br />
                <em>An exception may be granted if the new team plays at least 10 regular season games.</em>
            </li>
            <li>To change either a team's name or its home location and still retain the team's flight status and spot on any mTCT invitation list, the team must present an appeal to the corresponding USA Ultimate National Director describing its rationale. Appeals must be submitted prior to competing..</li>

                <strong>Coaching Requirements</strong><br />
                To coach any club team at a USA Ultimate sanctioned event (including all Regular Season and Postseason Events), a coach must be a member of USA Ultimate and have completed at least the Foundational Coach training. The steps to complete the Foundational Coach training can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/coaches/become-a-coach/">here</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>Coaching Sideline Access Policy</strong><br />
                During games at TCT events where field access is restricted (ex: US Open, Nationals), sideline access will only be granted to players, USA Ultimate Foundational Coaches that are designated by the team, USA Ultimate event staff and credentialed media*. All other non- player support staff with player-level or limited field access, including coaches, must read, sign and agree to abide by the USA Ultimate <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/usa-ultimate-coaching-ethics-code/">Coaching Code of Ethics</a> and <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/USA-Ultimate-Spirit-of-Coaching.pdf" target="blank">Spirit of Coaching Statement</a>. The limit on the number of coaches and team support personnel, all of whom must comply with the above policy, is as follows:

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Coaches (5) - may have player-level access to sidelines/field</li>
                    <li>Coaches must be listed on the team's online Event Roster prior to the event in order to have sideline access, which means coaches must have an active USA Ultimate membership and have satisfactorily passed the coaching and rules test.**</li>
                    <li>Team Support (2) - must remain in team tent/bench area during points</li>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>* Team media must contact the USA Ultimate media manager for credentials and event media waivers.</p>

        <p>** Teams must ensure that their coach is an active member of USA Ultimate, and has completed all necessary coaching requirements, including the SafeSport training and obtaining a "Green Light" on a NCSI Background check. Background checks take an average of 10 business days to complete and can be started on the coach's USAU membership dashboard once they login. Coaches who have lived outside of the United States in the last five (5) years should expect a longer turnaround time and a higher cost for their background checks.

                <strong>2023 Rules</strong><br />
                All USA Ultimate Regular Season and Postseason Events must use the “2022-2023 Official Rules of Ultimate” which are available at <a href="http://www.usaultimate.org/rules">usaultimate.org/rules</a> in HTML and PDF formats along with <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Substantive-Changes-from-the-2020-2021-Rules.pdf" target="blank">supporting documentation highlighting and explaining the substantive changes from the 2020-2021 Edition</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>Game Length Minimums</strong><br />
                TCT games should be scheduled to last at least 90 minutes and play to 15 points. All games at sanctioned USA Ultimate events must meet the minimum point and time-based requirements - each game must be initially set, at minimum, to 11 points and 60 minutes in length. Games under the minimums are subject to USA Ultimate review for inclusion in rankings or game counts.
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li><strong>NEVER</strong> report an inaccurate score. Doing so will result in game disqualifications and other sanctions to teams, organizers and players</li>
                    <li>If a game is a forfeit (see forfeit rule below), do NOT enter the score in as 13-0 or 15-0. You must inform the TD and report a W/F on the USA Ultimate reporting app.</li>
                    <li>Requests to shorten any game must be approved prior to playing by the event manager/TD and should still meet the minimum requirements mentioned above. Captains may not simply agree to play to a lower number or for a certain amount of time. This will result in consequences for both teams and both captains.</li>
                    <li>Games that are suspended due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reasons will be counted only if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total or half the minimum game length.</li>
                    <li>Games that do not reach halftime and cannot be continued should be recorded as “canceled.”</li>
                    <li>For mTCT events and the postseason halftime will be 7 minutes long. At the end of half time Rule 9.c. applies for restarting play.

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="forfeit-rule">
        <h3>J. Forfeit Rule</h3>

        <p>The competition format of an event and the season as a whole rely on scheduled games being played. As a general rule, USA Ultimate prohibits the forfeiting of scheduled games during the Regular Season. Teams are expected to play out their entire schedule of games at events they have chosen to enter. All teams entering an event should expect that their opponents will play their scheduled games. These rules apply regardless of the caliber of the opponent or the stage of the competition in which a game is scheduled.</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field, will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

            <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed at a rate of one (1) point per five (5) minutes. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will forfeit the game.</li>

            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums, found here.</li>

            <li>Reporting false scores will be treated with significant sanctions. If a game is forfeited, teams must report the forfeiture. If a game is not finished, scores and game length are to be reported as they are. Teams may not manipulate the final score to reach the game minimum. Violating this rule will incur sanctions for both teams involved. See the sanctions section (Item 6 below) for more information.</li>

            <li>
                <strong>Exceptions</strong>
                <ol class="lower-alpha">

        <h3>K. Eligibility</h3>

        <p>Teams participating in any Regular Season event or game must do so only with players who are on the team's Regular Season roster AND Event Roster for that event or game.</p>

        <h3>L. Season Roster Changes</h3>

        <p>For the 2023 season, to allow players and teams the time to host tryouts and establish rosters on a timeline they and their community are comfortable with, players will have the flexibility to play on multiple rosters from the start of the Regular Season until Tuesday July 4th. After the July 4th cutoff, players may switch rosters but not return to a roster after playing a Regular Season Event with a different team.</p>

        <p><em>Example:</em> Player A can play with Team X and Team Y interchangeably from the start of the Regular Season until July 4th. If Player A attends a Regular Season event with Team X on July 8-9, then an event with Team Y in August, that Player may NOT return to play any Regular Season event or the series with Team X. Doing so will result in disqualification from the event, games not counting, and potential suspensions for the Player and Team.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="geographic-eligibility">
        <h3>M. Geographic Eligibility</h3>

        <p>At least 50% of the players on a team's Season Roster must reside in the <strong>section</strong> in which that team will compete.</p>

        <p>At least 75% of the players on a team's Season Roster must reside in the <strong>region</strong> in which that team will compete.</p>

        <p>A team can roster no more than five (5) out-of-region players at any Regular Season Event in which the team will be competing. Additionally, a team may not roster more than seven (7) out-of-region players during the Regular Season.</p>

        <p>“Residence" is defined as meeting <strong>both</strong> of the below criteria:</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Location where the person is living for the majority of September and October, <strong>and</strong></li>
            <li>Location where the person is living for the majority of either the three months prior to September 1 or immediately following October 31.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the above definition means that a player does not have a region as their "residence," then the player is considered to be an out-of-region player and counts towards a team's out-of-region limits (maximum of five out-of-region players and no more than 25% of the roster).</p>

        <p>If a regional boundary divides a metropolitan area, a team based in that metropolitan area may request an exception for players living in that metropolitan area to count as in-region for that team. In order for an exception to be granted, a player and team must establish that the player is part of the local community in which the team is based. In order for teams to be in compliance with the geographic guidelines throughout the season, players must receive exception approval prior to participation with the team at a Regular Season or Postseason event. To request this exception, email your National Director and copy the Manager of Competition and National Team Programs <a href="mailto:clubmanager@usaultimate.org">clubmanager@usaultimate.org</a>.</p>

        <h3>N. Gender Division Eligibility</h3>

        <p>USA Ultimate will not discriminate on the basis of gender identity, regardless of sex assigned at birth, or any other form of gender expression for whether an athlete matches up against a woman-matching or man-matching player of the opposing team during any given point.</p>

        <p>We affirm that people of all gender identities should have the freedom to participate in USA Ultimate Regular Season or championship series events in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe based on their gender identity and should be recognized, respected and included at every level of the sport.</p>

        <p>Teams that are found to have violated the letter or spirit of the rules mentioned here, or whose behavior undermines the competition structure (e.g. misrepresenting the composition of a team at a specific event, misrepresenting the composition of a team over the course of the season, intentionally playing with ineligible players, intentionally misrepresenting gender for mixed on-field personnel ratio, etc.) will be subject to ramifications as outlined in "Violations and Sanctions." Roster violations should be reported to the Manager of Competition and National Team Programs at <a href="mailto:clubmanager@usaultimate.org">clubmanager@usaultimate.org</a>.</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>In their USA Ultimate membership account, every athlete should select the gender identity option that best aligns with their gender identity. When registering for a USA Ultimate Regular Season or championship series event, athletes should select to participate in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe based on their indicated gender identity.</li>
            <li>Players who select Man (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in Men's divisions or as a man-matching player in Mixed divisions.</li>
            <li>Players who select Woman (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in Men's or Women's divisions, or as a Woman-matching player in Mixed divisions.</li>
            <li>Players who select the Non-Binary or Prefer to Self-Report gender identity option are eligible to compete in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe, as per USA Ultimate's Gender Inclusion Policy (approved 11.2021).</li>
            <li><em>Note: For those who select Prefer to Self-Report, there will be a fill-in option to provide any additional information regarding your gender identity. This is for internal educational purposes only and will not be shared.</em></li>

        <p>The personnel ratio for the mixed division of the Triple Crown Tour regular season and postseason will be 4/3 (four woman-matching and three man-matching or four man-matching and three woman-matching).</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Determining the ratio</strong><br />
                <strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “prescribed ratio” rule (also known as Rule A in the official <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/documents/wfdf-rules-of-ultimate-2021-2024-appendix-v1/download" target="blank">WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2022-2024 - APPENDIX v1.0</a>:<br /><br />
                <em>Ratio Rule A (“prescribed ratio” rule):</em><br />
                At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the gender ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “majority pull” rule”<br />
                Each point, a player representing the gender match-up with four players on the field must pull for that point. That is, if there are four women-matching players a woman-matching player must pull.
            </li>

            <li><strong>For all Mixed games</strong>, if a team cannot match the on-field personnel ratio of all seven players on the team determining the personnel ratio for the point, then it must play with fewer than seven players, but no less than 5, matching the personnel ratio with as many players as possible.</li>

            <li>
                <strong>For all Mixed games –</strong>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>Personnel Ratio Violation: Violations of the prescribed personnel ratio and how they are handled are described in 2022-2023 Official Rules of Ultimate (9.B.3.a).</li>

                    <li>Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the majority pull rule will be handled the same as an offsides violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling "offsides," the offense should call "majority pull violation." Like with offsides violations, after the first majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as described in 9.B.4.d.2. Majority pull rule violations accumulate separately from offsides/false start violations. In games with observers, either the observer or a player on the field may call the violation.</li>

                    <li>after a goal and before the substituting team has signaled readiness; or</li>
                    <li>to replace injured players, replace players with illegal equipment, or to resolve an incorrect personnel violation. In this case, the opposing team may substitute a like number of, or fewer, players. In the Mixed Division the substituting players must be of the same gender match.</li>

                        Individual games may be sanctioned at the discretion of USA Ultimate in order to provide flexibility for teams in planning their seasons and scheduling playing opportunities. Match play sanctioning may require earlier sanctioning application deadlines, will be subject to the review of USA Ultimate staff and may require additional oversight and/or structure to ensure the integrity of the competition. For 2023, sanctioning fees for match play for Women's Division teams will be waived.

        <p>USA Ultimate is progressively increasing the minimum standards which tournaments/events are required to meet to receive sanctioning approval.

        <h3>T. Team Registration Requirements</h3>

        <p>All teams that compete in the Regular Season must submit an online Event Roster by the event- specific, rolling deadline (Wednesday prior to event). Teams are required to do the following:</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Notify the event organizer of their intention to compete in the event, acknowledge understanding that the team will be considered a Regular Season team and receive confirmation that the team has received a bid to the event.</li>

            <li>Once confirmed, use the online rostering system to submit the team's Event Roster for the event.</li>

            <li>Complete team's Event Roster by 5pm MDT on the <strong>Wednesday prior</strong> to the event.</li>

            <li>Ensure that USA Ultimate membership dues and individual waivers are submitted by every participant before they are added to an Event Roster. Players must be added to the Event Roster by 5pm MDT on the Wednesday prior to the event in order to participate.</li>

            <li>Any player found to play in a Regular Season <em>Event</em> without being on a team's Event Roster will face sanctions along with any other culpable parties, including, but not limited to the Team Manager, teammates, other teams and the event organizers. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, ejection from the event, fines and/or suspensions.</li>

        <h3>U. Rankings</h3>

        <p>The Final Regular Season Rankings are used to determine bid allocations for the Postseason. The rankings will be based on games played between eligible teams at Regular Season Events.</p>

        <p>The Regular Season Rankings algorithm will be run, and the rankings will be published weekly starting July 26, 2023.</p>

        <p>Teams must compete in a minimum of 10 Regular Season games to be included in the Final Regular Season Rankings, which impact bid allocation to Regionals and Nationals. We encourage teams to utilize match play as a way to compete locally.</p>

        <p>To support roster consistency between the Regular Season and Postseason for Classic and Select Flight teams, at least 50% of a team's Postseason Roster must consist of players that competed for the team during the Regular Season for the team's Regular Season ranking to count in the Postseason bid allocations.</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>
                Rankings Eligibility<br />
                Regular Season rankings are tentative, pending eligibility verification. At the end of the Regular Season, any eligibility-based adjustments will be made to finalize Regular Season rankings. Results of Regular Season Events or Games will not count if:

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>The event does not meet the USA Ultimate definition of Ultimate.</li>
                    <li>The competition rules of the event designate the number of players on the field for a team to be any number other than seven.</li>
                    <li>Games do not meet the minimum point and time-based requirements (each game must have been initially set to be, at minimum, to 11 points and 60 minutes in length).</li>
                    <li>An inaccurate score is reported.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Games suspended or modified due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reason may be counted if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total or half the minimum game length, at the discretion of USA Ultimate.</p>

        <p>If a team competes in a Regular Season event with ineligible players, the team will be treated as ineligible and its results will not count for the event. Any eligible opposing team that competes against the ineligible team at the event will receive credit for competing in the game (i.e., game will be included in the team's regular season game count), but the results of the game will not be included in the regular season rankings.</p>

        <p>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disallow Regular Season results if they are determined not to be in line with the goals of the USA Ultimate Triple Crown Tour or the mission and policies of USA Ultimate.</p>

        <p>Teams are not allowed to split to add additional teams to an event after the July 4th cutoff. Deliberate misrepresentation of a team registered for the Regular Season in order to influence Regular Season rankings will be considered a roster violation and may be subject to ramifications as outlined in the section titled "Violations and Sanctions." In addition to those sanctions, if such deliberate misrepresentation of a team is discovered, USA Ultimate reserves the right to assign a game result to whichever team it deems appropriate.</p>

                <strong>Team Registration</strong><br />
                <p>In order to participate in the Postseason, teams must be created via the online rostering system - or rolled over from a previous year (to roll a team over from 2020 or 2021 you may have to roll it over multiple times) and registered for their appropriate Postseason event with a valid Event Roster (10-player minimum) by Friday, August 25 at 5pm MDT. <strong>This date is the same for all teams regardless of flight or bye.</strong></p>

                <p>There is ONE Postseason Roster that is rolled over from Sectionals to Regionals to Nationals depending on team qualification. You CANNOT add players to your Regionals or Nationals event roster after the Postseason Event Roster Deadline (September 6, 2023). <strong>This deadline is the same for all teams, including teams advancing directly to Regionals.</strong></p>

                <p>Select and Classic Flight teams must register for their appropriate sectional event.</p>

                <p>Pro and Elite Flight teams that have met their respective requirements to earn a bye to Regionals and intend to advance directly to Regionals must accept their invitation to their regional event by August 25, 2022 (by 5pm MDT/7pm EDT). Otherwise they should contact their National Division Director to decline their bye and register for their appropriate sectional event by the August 25 5pm MDT deadline.</p>

                <p>If your sectional event has a player fee and your team has players that will not be attending, but do plan to attend Regionals upon qualification, please discuss with the Tournament Director to ensure accurate charges. ALL players must be on the Postseason Roster before Sectionals.</p>

                <p>All teams should contact their Sectional or Regional Coordinator before the Team Registration Deadline to confirm their participation in Sectionals. Coordinator contact info can be found on the USA Ultimate website.</p>

                <p>For the purposes of event logistics, tournament directors may work with USA Ultimate coordinators to impose a deadline by which teams must decide whether they will attend the tournament. This deadline may be associated with submission of a tournament entry fee. Tournament Directors may keep entry fees from teams that pull out of the tournament beyond a certain date, provided the date and fee are reasonable (for instance, the date cannot be before the Team Registration Deadline), were approved by the National Division Director and were communicated to the teams ahead of time. Early tournament registration dates will be documented on the event listing on the USA Ultimate website. Any deadline imposed by a coordinator or tournament director that would restrict access to the tournament for teams that would otherwise be considered eligible must be announced well in advance and must be approved by the National Division Director.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Pro and Elite bids</strong> - The number of bids available to Regionals per the bid process below will be reduced by the number of Pro and Elite teams receiving a bye to Regionals. For example, in a 12-team regional championship event that includes two Pro or Elite teams using a bye to regionals, there will be 10 bids remaining for distribution to the sections in that region.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Auto bids</strong> - The number of auto bids per region is equal to 50% of the total bids available after regional scaling. If there are an odd number of bids, there will be one more auto bid than strength bids. All sections with at least one team registered for the Postseason will receive at least one auto bid to Regionals. Regional auto bids will be awarded first to the section with the greatest team count based on the Team Registration Deadline. The next bid will be awarded to the section with the second highest team count and so on until all auto bids have been awarded.</li>

                                            <li>Team Strength Bids - Team Strength bids to Regionals will be awarded to the section with the "next" highest ranked team that is participating in the postseason, based on regular season rankings for results through Sunday, August 27, where "next" describes one more bid than the section has already been awarded up to that point. (For example: a section with four bids and a section with two bids will compare their fifth and third ranked teams, respectively, for a Team Strength Bid).</li>

                                            <li>Sections may earn more than one Team Strength Bid. All strength bids will be awarded as Team Strength Bids unless the region does not have enough ranked teams.</li>

                                            <li>Sectional Strength Bids - If all ranked teams have been assigned Strength Bids and there are still additional bids to be assigned, average power rating of the ranked teams who are participating in the Postseason will be considered.</li>

                                        The next highest finishing, non-qualifying team from each section will be compared to one another. The team with the highest final regular season ranking will be awarded the next bid. This process will be repeated until all bids have been awarded.

                    <li>Seeding for any postseason event must be approved by the next coordinator in the chain of command.

        <h3>W. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of the Triple Crown Tour guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate <a href="https://usaultimate.org/conduct/code-of-conduct/">conduct process</a>. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.</p>

        <p>Disqualification may include not only elimination of the team from the current season, but also limitations on participation of players during the remainder of the current season, and limitation on participation of the team (and its players) in subsequent seasons.</p>

        <p>In order to help teams follow Triple Crown Tour guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Triple Crown Tour. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding information.</p>

        <p>Since consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the TCT, many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
