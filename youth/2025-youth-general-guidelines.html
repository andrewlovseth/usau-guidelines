        <h3>Minor (Under 18) Player Info</h3>
        <p>
            Minors participating in any event must have a <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/medical-authorization-form/" target="_blank">Medical Authorization Form</a> completed prior
            to participation. A team with minors on it must have one or more approved, background-checked chaperones
            listed on the team's official roster.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong
                >The Medical Authorization Form is the responsibility of the chaperone; it must be brought to each USAU
                event and kept on hand by the chaperone.</strong
            >
            This form will allow medical personnel to treat an injured minor without a parent/guardian having to be
            present.
            <em
                ><strong>Note:</strong> A Medical Authorization is not the same as the USAU liability waiver (which can
                be signed on a player's account homepage).</em

        <h3>School-Based vs. Youth Club</h3>
        <p>
            For school-based events, i.e. High School and Middle School State Championships, it is expected that all
            students are competing with their primary full-time school where they are seeking a diploma or equivalent.
            If all students do not attend the same school, they must request exceptions in advance according to the
            guidelines of that event.
        </p>
        <p>
            For youth club events, i.e. YCC and Youth Club Regionals, teams may consist of any youth players within
            their youth region. Overall, the youth division is designed to support players who are in the high-school
            phase of life or younger.

                A team must play all of its scheduled games at a tournament.

                    <li>

                        manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a
                        match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the discretion of the event's USAU coordinator, consideration may be given to situations that
                        might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of
                        the competition.

            <li>
                A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely
