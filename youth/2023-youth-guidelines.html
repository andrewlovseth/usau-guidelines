        <h3>Covid-19 Note</h3>
        <p><em>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, USA Ultimate regularly reviews and revises its related policies and procedures, keeping player and community safety at the forefront and as the number one priority. These protocols were developed based on the most recent recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and expert input from the USA Ultimate Medical Advisory Group: a panel of doctors and other health care professionals.</em></p>

        <p><em>Ultimate activities include an assumption of risk on the part of the participants. Closely following all state, local and event-related health and safety protocols, including the procedures outlined below, helps limit the spread of COVID-19 and better protects our community. COVID vaccinations, including boosters for those eligible, are highly encouraged for all ultimate players and community members. Regular testing is also recommended, especially in conjunction with travel, team activities and participation in events.</em></p>

        <p><em>Contact <a href="mailto:COVID@usaultimate.org">COVID@usaultimate.org</a> if you have questions about these policies or need to report an event-related COVID incident or infection prior to, during, or following an event.</em></p>

        <h3>Youth Guidelines Purpose</h3>
        <p>This document is designed to layout player requirements for a variety of youth playing opportunities, including, but not limited to, high school and middle school state championship events for school-based play and youth club regional events and the Youth Club Championships (YCC) for age-based youth club play.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="updates-for-2023">
        <h3>Updates for 2023</h3>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Teams attending Middle and High School State Championship events must have at least one middle or high school certified coach, respectively. In addition, all coaches must have a current Foundational Coach training at the time of the tournament, including an active membership, current SafeSport training completed, and cleared background check as well.
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>However, first year teams competing at a USAU state championship event (both middle and high school) are not required to meet the coach certification requirement. This is meant to help make these events more accessible for new teams and players to participate. Coaches are still encouraged to become certified, since they will be required to meet this expectation the following year.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>For teams applying to/interested in YCC:
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>YCC has moved from Blaine, Minnesota to Aurora, Colorado in 2023, taking place August 5-7. Past 2023, there is no current information on location and dates for proceeding YCC’s unless otherwise announced.</li>
                    <li>For YCC and regional youth club events, players can be no younger than 12 years old at the time of the event for a U17 event and no younger than 14 years old at the time of the event for a U20 event.</li>
                    <li>Changes potentially coming to the YCC qualifying process after 2023 (see note in 2023 USAU Youth Club Championships section).</li>
                    <li>Updated description around YCC player eligibility (see 2023 USAU Youth Club Championships section for full eligibility description). You are eligible for YCC if you:
                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li>Meet the age requirement</li>
                            <li>Were enrolled in high school or middle school in the academic year leading into the current year's YCC</li>
                            <li>Have never been rostered with a college team (on a college team personnel roster)</li>
                        </ul>

        <h3>Updates from 2022</h3>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>For teams applying to YCC:
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>If your organization is applying to send two boys’ teams for YCC, it must also be applying to send either a girls’ or a mixed team. Acceptance of a second boys’ team may be contingent on your organization accepting the bid and fielding that girls’ or mixed team.</li>
                    <li>Medical Authorization Forms will be collected electronically.</li>
                    <li>For the U20 Mixed Division, we will be following WFDF Rule A:
                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li> Games played at the Youth Club Championship for the U20 Mixed Division will also have an additional disc flip after the initial flip, where the winner will decide the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern). This is in line with WFDF's Rule A, also known as the “prescribed ratio” rule described in the official <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/documents/wfdf-rules-of-ultimate-2021-2024-appendix-v1/download" target="window">WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024 - APPENDIX v1.0</a>.</li>
                            <li>In addition to Rule A, whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group will need to pull. For example, if there are 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their woman-matching players must pull the disc and vice versa.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Player minimums are going from 12 to 14 players per team, and for mixed divisions, at least 6 man-matching and 6 woman-matching players instead of 4 man-matching and 4 woman-matching.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Instead of Fall Youth Cups, we are encouraging organizers to set up and run regional youth events to encourage more playing opportunities across state borders.
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>For these regional youth events, player minimums are going from 12 to 14 players per team, and for mixed divisions, at least 6 man-matching and 6 woman-matching players instead of 4 man-matching and 4 woman-matching.</li>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>The coach, team representative, or the player in question should consult with the State Youth Coordinator.</li>

            <li>The inquiry form must be filled out completely, and submitted between January 1 and April 5. Late requests will be considered at the discretion of the Committee.</li>

        <h3>2023 USA Ultimate High School Guidelines</h3>

        <p>The USAU State High School State Championship program is expanding. Organizations are chosen to host a USAU HS State Championship at the discretion of the State Youth Coordinator, Regional Youth Director, and Manager of Youth Competition and National Team Programs, with priority given to State-Based Organizations and Affiliates.</p>

        <p>The criteria weighed in granting USAU sponsorship to a new HS State Championship are:</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Reliable organizers to host the event.</li>
            <li>Keeping the growth at a level where high quality training can be provided to new organizers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A "state tournament" can be an independent event, run by a local organization or organizer, but it must be sanctioned by USA Ultimate. State tournaments are most often used to prepare for running a State Championship in upcoming seasons.</p>

        <p>A State Championship is a specific state tournament, owned by USA Ultimate and run by the USA Ultimate Competition State Youth Coordinator (SYC).</p>

        <p>In 2022, the states hosting USA Ultimate High School State Championships were the following: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>

        <h4 id="hs-championship-requirements">Requirements for USAU High School State Tournaments & Championships</h4>

        <p>A <a href="https://usaultimate.org/host-a-championship-event/">bid document</a> must be submitted to the State Youth Coordinator (SYC), who will submit it to the Regional Youth Director (RYD) and Youth Competition Manager. If your state does not have an SYC, it should be submitted to the RYD. Contact information for SYCs and RYDs can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">here</a>.</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>The state tournament or championship must be publicly announced to local organizers and via USA Ultimate web properties at least six weeks prior to the event. Announcement must include:
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>Date(s) of event</li>
                    <li>Location of event</li>
                    <li>Contact information for event</li>
                    <li>Registration requirements</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>The state tournament must include every HS team in the state that meets the State Youth Coordinator's deadlines.
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>In the event that there are too many in-state teams to accommodate at a state tournament, there must be a USAU qualifying event(s)* for the state tournament.</li>
                    <li>b. If there is a qualification process or qualifying event for one team within the state, then all teams must participate in the qualification process or appropriate qualifying events. <em>Example: If North Carolina were running Qualifying Events in Raleigh and Wilmington, then Charlotte teams must also compete in a Qualifying Event in order to be eligible for the state championship tournament.</em></li>
                    <li>The State Championship can include teams from outside of the state as long as it does not prohibit in-state teams that have met the registration requirements from participating. Additionally, both the SYC and the RYD should be made aware of this arrangement.</li>
                    <li>Teams cannot be directed to participate in a secondary event (such as a Division II or developmental division) without a Qualifying Event, unless they choose to do so.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <p>*Qualifying Events: To be considered a qualifying event, the qualifying USAU-sanctioned structure for states must be accessible for everyone to participate in it. Any questions around what is considered a qualifying event, please contact your RYD.</p>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Application and compliance of the above guidelines will be subject to the discretion of the State Youth Coordinator, Regional Youth Director, and USA Ultimate Manager of Competition and National Team Programs - Youth.</em></p>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>If the student is part of a <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/home-school-cooperative/">USAU-recognized homeschool cooperative</a>, they may participate as part of that cooperative's ultimate team, provided that team meets the state tournament participation requirements. This homeschool cooperative must be renewed every two years and may be reviewed by USA Ultimate at earlier intervals if needed.</li>
                    <li>If the student is not part of a USAU-recognized homeschool cooperative, they may participate as part of the ultimate team at the public middle school that they would normally attend, provided that team meets the state tournament participation requirements.</li>
                    <li>If a student is a regular member of a school they may not play with any other school, regardless of any homeschool designation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Players under the age of 18 must have a completed <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/medical-authorization-form/">Medical Authorization</a> form onsite at the event with their coach or chaperone.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="hs-eligibility-exceptions">4. State Eligibility Exceptions</h4>

        <p>The USAU Youth Guidelines provide a framework for school-based play across the country. However, State Youth Coordinators can create modifications to eligibility rules for their entire state up to one month before the event date with Regional Youth Director and USA Ultimate approval.</p>

        <p>If approved, these modifications will supersede the USAU eligibility guidelines for that state and must be applied consistently and to all teams within that state. These exceptions can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SE_ZdUdOZoQuOIq5CrbAvnOSm9CEvHzTMT3ZqL8y4jE/edit" target="window">here</a> and will be updated after April 1.</p>

        <h4 id="hs-coach-requirements">5. Coach Requirements</h4>

        <p>All teams are required to have a minimum of <strong>ONE</strong> USAU HS certified coach present and listed on the official event roster for all State Championships and Qualifying Events, unless it is a team's first year competing at their state championship event. Then they are granted an exception to this requirement. Coaches for High School State Championships must be over 18, and they cannot be a student at the school for which they coach. Information on where to obtain certification can be found here.</p>

        <h4 id="hs-violations">6. Violations</h4>

        <p>Violations of these rules may result in disqualification of a team or individual from the State Championships and possible repercussions through the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/conduct/code-of-conduct/">USAU Conduct Policy</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="hs-clarifications">6. Clarifications and Exceptions</h4>

        <p>These rules are designed to be as fair as possible for the wide range of players participating in the State Championships. Experience has shown that there can be cases where these rules do not absolutely determine the eligibility of a particular player. The following procedure is available for players/teams for whom the rules are not clear:</p>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>The coach, team representative, or the player in question should consult with the State Youth Coordinator and the State Eligibility Exceptions, which are linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SE_ZdUdOZoQuOIq5CrbAvnOSm9CEvHzTMT3ZqL8y4jE/edit" target="window">here</a> and will be updated after April 1.</li>
            <li>If the case is not clarified by the State Exceptions, the player can submit an <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/states-youth-eligibility-exception-form/">exception request</a> to the State Youth Coordinator, who will consult the Regional Youth Director and USAU Manager of Competition National Team Programs - Youth for how to proceed.</li>
            <li>In the event that the coach, team representative, or the player feels that the decision is biased, or all aspects have not been considered, they may submit an appeal. To do this, please email <a href="mailto:youth_elig_chair@usaultimate.org">youth_elig_chair@usaultimate.org</a>.</li>
            <li>An email to appeal must be sent to the Youth Eligibility Committee at least two weeks before the rostering deadline for the event. Late requests will be considered at the discretion of the Committee.</li>
            <li>The inquiry will be reviewed by the Committee and responses sent by email.</li>
            <li>Email <a href="mailto:youth_elig_chair@usaultimate.org">youth_elig_chair@usaultimate.org</a> if the form is not available or for any other questions.</li>
            <p>The Eligibility Committee will rule on a player's case based on the published Youth Competition Guidelines; <strong>this is not the mechanism for requesting changes to the guidelines</strong>. Please contact the <a href="mailto:dana@hq.usaultimate.org"></a>Youth Manager of Competition and National Team Programs</a> on the process for proposing changes.</p>

        <p>The goal of this event is to provide national-level competition for youth ultimate players and encourage local playing opportunities for youth within the USAU structure. In 2023, USA Ultimate will be accepting bids for two separate age divisions – U20 and U17.
