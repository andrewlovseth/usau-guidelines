                A USAU High School State Championship is the pinnacle event of school-based play. Organizations are
                chosen to host a USAU HS State Championship at the discretion of the State Youth Coordinator (SYC),
                Regional Youth Director (RYD), and Manager of Youth Competition and National Team Programs, with hosting
                priority offered to
                <a href="https://usaultimate.org/affiliate-program/" target="window">Affiliate organizations</a>. A
                State Championship is a specific state tournament for each gender division, owned by USA Ultimate and
                operated at the direction of the USA Ultimate Competition State Youth Coordinator (SYC). Reliable
                organizers to host the events and train future organizers are critical to sustain these highly
                successful events.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2024, the states hosting USA Ultimate High School State Championships were the following: California,
                Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey,
                New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

                The USAU Youth Guidelines provide a framework for school-based play across the country. However, State
                Youth Coordinators can create modifications to eligibility rules for their entire state up to one month
                before the event date with Regional Youth Director and USA Ultimate approval.

                    If approved, these modifications will supersede the USAU eligibility guidelines for that state and

            <h4>Coach Requirements</h4>
            <p>
                All teams are required to have a minimum of ONE USAU Youth certified coach present and listed on the
                official event roster for all State Championships and Qualifying Events, unless it is a team's first
                year competing at their state championship event. Then they are granted an exception to this
                certification requirement and must have at least one rostered coach with at least completed Foundational
                Coach Training. Coaches for High School State Championships must be at least age 18, and they cannot be
                a student at the school for which they coach.

                These rules are designed to be as fair as possible for the wide range of players participating in the
                State Championships. Experience has shown that there can be cases where these rules do not absolutely
                determine the eligibility of a particular player. The following procedure is available for players/teams
                for whom the rules are not clear:

                    The coach, team representative, or the player in question should consult with the State Youth

                <li>
                    In the event that the coach, team representative, or the player feels that the decision is biased,
                    or all aspects have not been considered, they may submit an appeal to the Youth Eligibility
                    Committee via email at

                    Committee.

                The Eligibility Committee will rule on a player's case based on the published Youth Competition
