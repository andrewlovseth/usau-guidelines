        <h3>2025 Jan-Aug Youth Club Guidelines</h3>

        <p>The <strong>Youth Club Division</strong> is designed to include as many players as possible who are in 12th grade and below, while maintaining consistent cutoffs that allow for fair competition. During the summer, we also extend this invite to players who have just graduated High School in the past few months. This supersedes the age division cuts-offs.</p>

        <h3>Team Requirements</h3>

        <ol class="numeric">

                    <li>No coach or chaperone may be listed on two or more rosters at the same event (including across multiple gender or age divisions). Those fulfilling the required roles of certified coaches and chaperones <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">CANNOT</strong> compete in ICC (the adult U.S. Open) during YCC.</li>
                    <li>A coach who meets the chaperone requirements may fulfill both roles on one team roster.</li>

                    <li>the location where the person is living for the majority of the 3 months prior to August.</li>
                    <li>If the above definition means that a player does not have a region as their "residence", then the player is considered to be an out-of-region player.</li>
                    <li>Teams are allowed a maximum of 4 out-of-region players. If you have out-of-region players, you will need to provide the reasons that these players are on your roster in <a href="https://forms.gle/KWUY7QR6MNARYnYt5" target="_blank">this form</a>.</li>
                </ol>

        <h3>Player Requirements</h3>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Players must be students currently enrolled in high school, middle school, or junior high. Recent high school graduates are permitted if they have graduated (or received a GED) within the 9 months prior to August 2, 2025.</li>
            <li>No player can currently or previously have played college ultimate; rostered as practicing with team or competed at a sanctioned event</li>
            <li>Each player on the roster must be a USA Ultimate member in good standing at all times during the event. Players may not use Affiliate Membership or pay one-time event fees for YCR.</li>
            <li>No player may be listed on two or more rosters at the same event (including across multiple gender or age divisions).</li>
            <li>Players under the age of 18 must have a completed <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/medical-authorization-form/">Medical Authorization Form</a> onsite at the event with their coach or chaperone.</li>
            <li>To be eligible for an <strong>Under-20 (U20) Division</strong>, players must be between <strong>ages of 14 and 19</strong> on both the start date of the Youth Club Championships (8/2/2025) and at the end of the year (i.e., birthdate between 1/1/2006 and 8/2/2011).</li>
            <li>To be eligible for an <strong>Under-17 (U17) Division</strong>, players must be between <strong>ages of 12 and 16</strong> on both the start date of the Youth Club Championships (8/2/2025) and at the end of the year (i.e., birthdate between 1/1/2009 and 8/2/2013).</li>

            <li>Organizations can apply for player eligibility exceptions based on special needs to fill their team roster(s). All divisions are eligible for this process. Girls' teams and female-matching players in mixed are more likely to receive consideration. Organizations will submit their eligibility requests through the <a href="https://forms.gle/2TBkFQF1jMgVazzf6" target="_blank">Regionals Organization Request for Player Eligibility Exception Form</a> or <a href="https://forms.gle/rej5ytUeefVp6iRYA" target="_blank">YCC Organization Request for Player Eligibility Exception Form</a>.</li>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="mixed-ratio">
        <h3>On-Field Personnel Ratio for Mixed Division</h3>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>The personnel ratio for the mixed division of the Youth Club Championships and Regionals will be 4:3 (4 man-matching players and 3 woman-matching players, or 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players), adhering to WFDF Rule A:
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>These games will also have an additional disc flip after the initial flip, where the winner will decide the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points, the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points, the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern). This is in line with WFDF's Rule A, also known as the "prescribed ratio" rule described in the official <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/documents/wfdf-rules-of-ultimate-2021-2024-appendix-v1/download" target="_blank">WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024 - APPENDIX v1.0</a>.</li>
                    <li>In addition to Rule A, whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group will need to pull. For example, if there are 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their woman-matching players must pull the disc to start the point and vice versa.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If a team cannot match the on-field personnel gender-matching ratio of all 7 players, then it must play with fewer than 7 players, matching the personnel gender-matching ratio with as many players as possible.</li>
            <li>Injury timeouts
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>In the event of an injury time-out where a player leaves the field, the replacing player must maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the injured player.</li>
                    <li>If a team replaces players, the opposing team has the option of substituting a like number of, or fewer players.</li>
                    <li>The replacing player(s) must maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the player(s) they replace.</li>
                    <li>If a team calls an injury time-out but does not have a replacement player to maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the injured player, it may not replace that player and must play with fewer than 7 players.</li>

        <h3>2025 Jan-Aug Y outh Club Regional Events (YCR)</h3>

        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>USA Ultimate is looking for organizations to help us expand the regional youth club competition structure. These events bring together teams from different areas, ideally from within the host region, to compete against one another. These regional events should typically be much more accessible than Youth Club Championships (YCC), at least in the divisions of YCC where demand tends to exceed capacity, and these regional events should also allow for inclusion of younger age divisions than YCC (e.g. U15 or younger). These tournaments will serve three major functions by providing:</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Warm-up opportunities for teams preparing to compete at YCC in August.</li>
            <li>An accessible event for teams who may pursue attending YCC in subsequent years.</li>
            <li>A season-culminating event for teams who are not competing at YCC.</li>

        <h3>2025 USA Ultimate Y outh Club Championships (August 2-4, Aurora, CO)</h3>
        
        <h4 id="ycc-overview">Overview</h4>

        <p>The goal of this event is to provide national-level competition for youth ultimate players and encourage local playing opportunities for youth within the USAU structure. In 2025, USA Ultimate will be accepting bids for two separate age divisions - U20 and U17. The guidelines that follow are USAU's requirements for qualification and criteria for acceptance for the USAU Youth Club Championships. As this is a growing division, these guidelines and the bid allocation process are subject to change.</p>

        <p><em>Organizations that have outstanding events open from the previous year (tournaments and/or leagues that have never been closed out with USAU) will not be considered for Phase 1.</em></p>

        <p>Second teams within a single Boys* or Mixed division from an organization, and international teams, may apply at any time, but their applications will not be considered until after Phase 1.</p>

        <p>The purpose of multiple bid deadlines is to accommodate organizations and teams that want to know early in the year how many bids they will receive and in which of the division(s) where demand currently exceeds capacity (i.e. all Boys and Mixed divisions). In recognizing that not all organizations are ready to bid early, while also recognizing that the earlier a team has a secured spot in the event around which they can then establish team formation and plan to attend, Phase 2 was created to fill any vacant spots in those divisions that may remain after Phase 1 offers are accepted, if any spots still remain, and to give a second opportunity for new organizations to apply.</p>

Following is the team bid priority determination flowchart (where a lower placement value indicates higher priority/order of bid awards to be extended):</p>

        <h4>Flowchart descriptions and definitions</h4>

        <p>
            <strong>Top Level: “USAU High School State Championship?”</strong><br/>
            (Can be hosted by any organization at the direction of the State Youth Coordinator, as long as it was for school-based teams in the state territory where the LDO operates. Does not have to be hosted/operated by the LDO submitting the YCC team bid.)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>2nd Level: “USAU Sanctioned Youth Club Regional Event or Local League?”</strong><br/>
            (Did the LDO either host a USAU sanctioned <a href="#ycr">Youth Club Regional</a> event or operate a USAU  sanctioned Youth Club League that is not school-based, only age-based? Any event that meets the highest priority criteria will be eligible.)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>3rd Level: “USAU Affiliate?”</strong><br/>
            (Is the LDO a current USA Ultimate Affiliate in good standing on the date of team bid evaluation? If so, higher priority.)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4th Level: “USAU Sanctioned High School League?”</strong><br/>
            (Did the LDO operate a USAU sanctioned league for middle or high school-based teams?)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>G = “Yes, including a Girls division”</strong><br/>
            (pathway to leftward higher priorities, for event types operated that included a Girls/Gx & Non-Binary gender division for teams entirely composed of players in that gender identity spectrum)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Y = “Yes, but without a Girls division”</strong><br/>
            (pathway to middle priorities, for event types operated that included Mixed gender and/or Boys/Open gender divisions only but not Girls/Gx & Non-Binary gender)
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>N = “No”</strong><br/>
           (pathway to rightward lower priorities, for event types not operated for any gender division)
        </p>

        <p>LDO = local disc organization submitting and/or being represented by the team bid submission.</p>

        <p>Total priority values = 54 (1 being the highest priority, 54 the lowest)</p>

        <p>In the event that two teams have equal priority status on the above diagram, the bid priority will be given to the team that has the larger number of participants in their eligible club event and high school leagues, combined.</p>
        
        <p>For each of the priority levels, events operated within 18 months prior to YCC are eligible to meet the criteria. For August 2025 YCC, events operated from Jan 2024-July 2025 are eligible. For events scheduled for future operation at the time of the YCC bid application, the appropriate event/league application and/or hosting documentation must be submitted prior to the YCC phase team bid submission deadline.</p>

        <p>After all team bids in a phase have been evaluated for appropriate priority level, the details will be published for a period of one week, to allow time for review by submitters to ensure accuracy, prior to team bid awards being finalized and distributed. Specific event names and dates should be submitted along with the team bid application, in order to increase the accuracy of identifying the qualifying criteria for each bid's priority level.</p>

        <p>*Note: <em>If an organization is applying to send two boys' teams to YCC (in either age division), it must also be applying to send either a girls' or a mixed team (in any age division). Acceptance of a second boys' team will be contingent on the organization accepting the bid award for the girls' or mixed team (and fielding that team).</em></p>
