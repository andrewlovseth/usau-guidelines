        <h3>Youth Guidelines Purpose</h3>
        <p>This document is designed to layout player requirements for a variety of youth playing opportunities, including, but not limited to, high school and middle school state championship events for school-based play and youth club regional events and the Youth Club Championships (YCC) for age-based youth club play.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="updates-for-2024">
        <h3>Updates for 2024</h3>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>The YCC Bid Order of Priority Chart switched the second- and third-tiered priorities, effectively giving more priority to organizations running sanctioned youth club leagues and youth club events (now called Youth Club Regionals) over the priority of being an Affiliate/SBO organization (see re-ordered bid priority chart in the YCC section of the guidelines).</li>

            <li>
                Youth club player eligibility rules have been further clarified for 2024. Players must meet the following eligibility requirements to compete in YCC:

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Current student enrolled in grade 12 or below or be a recent high school graduate</li>
                    <li>No college playing experience</li>
                    <li>Meets age requirements</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                To ensure consistent and fair competition, players cannot request exceptions to these rules (see follow-up point below). 

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>YCC Player Eligibility Exception Requests must come from the organization and are related to needs to appropriately fill their roster(s). Girls' teams and female-matching players in mixed are more likely to receive consideration. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>YCC will have a shorter application window for Phase 1 (approximately one versus two months) to help those organizations that are ready and hoping to hear back about their team's acceptance as soon as possible. Depending on when teams apply as well as which and how many teams apply during Phase 1, there is potential for rolling acceptances for top priority teams during the application window.</li>

            <li>The Middle School Coach Certification requirement was removed for middle school state championships this year. Coaches are only required to be a Foundational Coach, but are strongly encouraged to become MS coach certified.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Youth League Sanctioning</h3>

        <p><a href="https://usaultimate.org/sanctioning/league-sanctioning/">League Sanctioning Requirements</a></p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Submit all player materials (rosters and USAU waivers) to USAU within the first week of the league beginning (rolling rosters are accepted - the first must be submitted with the first week of league).</li>

            <li>Submit all chaperone names BEFORE the event occurs. All chaperones must have all <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/chaperoning/">requirements</a> met before the youth event occurs. If more chaperones are added throughout the event, please make sure you are submitting their names to USAU, along with any additional player rosters.</li>

            <li>All players must have verified USAU waivers.</li>

            <li>All players must have a current player membership.</li>

            <li>All materials must be finalized and received by USAU within <strong>5 business days</strong> of the conclusion of the league (including payment of missing memberships).</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>If organizations have outstanding events open from the previous year (events that have never been closed out with USAU), they will not be considered during Phase 1 for YCC.</em></p>

        <h3>USAU Youth Rules Recommendations</h3>

        <p>With the adoption of the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/">2024-25 Rules</a>, USA Ultimate has introduced recommendations for different ages of youth play. These recommendations can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/#appendix_d">here</a> under “Appendix D: Youth Rules Adaptations”.</p>

        <p>Youth programs are not required to follow these recommendations, but we would like to know what rules and format our youth programs are following.

        <h3>2024 USA Ultimate Middle School Guidelines</h3>

        <h4 id="ms-championship-requirements">Requirements for USAU Middle School State Championships</h4>

        <p>A <a href="https://usaultimate.org/host-a-championship-event/">bid document</a> must be submitted to the State Youth Coordinator (SYC), who will submit it to the Regional Youth Director (RYD) and the Youth Competition Manager. If your state does not have an SYC, it should be submitted to the RYD. Contact information for SYCs and RYDs can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The State Championship must be publicly announced to local organizers and via USA Ultimate web properties at least six (6) weeks prior to the event. Announcement must include:</p>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Date(s) of event</li>
            <li>Location of event</li>
            <li>Contact information for event</li>
            <li>Registration requirements</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="ms-team-info">Team Info</h4>

        <p>All teams must submit an official 2024 State Championship roster by the deadlines outlined in the guidelines. USAU memberships and all individual waivers must also be completed prior to participation at the State Championships.</p>

        <p>Membership options for players participating in a MS State Championship event include:</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>A full Youth membership</li>
            <li>Players that are members of a USAU Affiliate may participate in the MS State Championships with their Affiliate membership, rather than a full Youth membership</li>
            <li>New players who are participating in a MS State Championship for the first time can purchase a Youth Intro membership rather than the full Youth membership</li>
            <li>Players can also participate with a one-time event fee</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="ms-regisration-deadline">1. Event/Team Registration Deadline</h4>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>All teams competing in a State Championship or Qualifying Event must be registered <strong><em>in the USAU online system (EMS)</em></strong> for the appropriate event <strong>two weeks prior to the event</strong>.
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Teams without this information registered in the online system by this deadline will be ineligible to compete.</li>
                    <li>Teams that miss the deadline may contact the State Youth Coordinator. Late admittance may be granted pending completion of registration steps (USAU qualified chaperone and Foundational Coach with MS certification* (*see exception for this described below)).</li>
                    <li>Registering your team in EMS requires having a Chaperone and a coach on the roster. Players can be rostered until one week before the event.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li id="ms-chaperones">Each team must have a registered and rostered <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/chaperoning/" target="window">Chaperone</a> who has:

                </ul>

                <p>Each team must have a chaperone listed on the event roster (please see the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/youth/team-organizers/">Team Organizers</a> page for details on <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/how-to-create-a-team/">team creation</a> and <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/team-and-player-registration/">event registration</a>) by the team registration deadline. In order to meet the event deadlines, teams must have Chaperones begin the background check process <strong>no later than two (2) weeks prior</strong> to the team registration deadline (i.e. four weeks prior to the event).</p>
            </li>

            <li>Every coach on the roster must be a Foundational Coach who has:
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>met the age requirement (18 years or older)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>For the 2024 Middle School State Championships, team rosters will <strong>only require one Foundational Coach </strong> (described above) by the team registration deadline and will not be required to have a MS certified coach. (Please see the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/youth/team-organizers/">Team Organizers</a>  page for details on <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/how-to-create-a-team/">team creation</a> and <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/team-and-player-registration/">event registration</a> if you have questions around adding a coach to a team roster.) However, teams are <em>highly encouraged</em> to have a MS certified coach on their roster. Information on where to obtain a Middle School coach certification can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/coaches/coach-certification/">here</a>. In order to meet the event deadlines, teams must have coaches begin the background check process no later than two weeks prior to the team registration deadline (i.e. four weeks prior to the event).</p>


        <p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be additional registration information required by your State Youth Coordinator. Contact your <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">State Youth Coordinator</a> in advance of the registration deadline for more details.</p>

        <h4 id="ms-rostering-deadline">2. Rostering Deadline: One week before the State Championships</h4>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Online rostering must be completed <strong>one week prior to a team's State Championship</strong> (for example, if a team's State Championship is May 11-12, rostering must be completed by May 4).</li>
            <li>State Youth Coordinators may set an earlier deadline for rostering in coordination with their Regional Youth Director.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="ms-on-site-player-additions">3. On-site Player Additions</h4>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>State Youth Coordinators will not accept on-site rosters or player additions. If you expect to need an exception, please discuss this with your SYC prior to the player registration deadline.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="ms-player-eligibility">4. Player Eligibility</h4>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>USA Ultimate Middle School State Championship events are competitions for school-based teams. All players on teams participating in the event must meet the following guidelines for “Middle School Players.”</li>

            <li>To be considered a Middle School Player, students must meet the following requirements:
                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Students must be regular members of the school they represent in order to participate in an interscholastic athletic activity.
                        <ol class="numeric">
                            <li>Students are a "regular member" of a school if they are enrolled half time or more, exclusive of interscholastic athletic activities.</li>
                            <li>If a student is enrolled in multiple schools such that no single school represents greater than 50% of their schooling, then that student's playing options will be guided by the homeschool player eligibility framework below.</li>
                            <li>In cases where schools can provide supporting documentation, USA Ultimate allows two or more schools meeting certain requirements to compete as a consortium (single-team from multiple schools) in the USA Ultimate Middle School division. More details can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/youth-consortium-program/" target="window">here</a>. The State Youth Coordinator, in conjunction with the Regional Youth Director, may determine that schools without a prior history of collaboration can function as a consortium at the Middle School level.</li>

        <h3>2024 USA Ultimate High School Guidelines</h3>

        <p>The USAU State High School State Championship program is expanding. Organizations are chosen to host a USAU HS State Championship at the discretion of the State Youth Coordinator, Regional Youth Director, and Manager of Youth Competition and National Team Programs, with priority given to State-Based Organizations and Affiliates.</p>

        <p>The criteria weighed in granting USAU sponsorship to a new HS State Championship are:</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Reliable organizers to host the event.</li>
            <li>Keeping the growth at a level where high quality training can be provided to new organizers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A "state tournament" can be an independent event, run by a local organization or organizer, but it must be sanctioned by USA Ultimate. State tournaments are most often used to prepare for running a State Championship in upcoming seasons.</p>

        <p>A State Championship is a specific state tournament, owned by USA Ultimate and run by the USA Ultimate Competition State Youth Coordinator (SYC).</p>

        <p>In 2023, the states hosting USA Ultimate High School State Championships were the following: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>

        <h4 id="hs-championship-requirements">Requirements for USAU High School State Tournaments & Championships</h4>

        <p>A <a href="https://usaultimate.org/host-a-championship-event/">bid document</a> must be submitted to the State Youth Coordinator (SYC), who will submit it to the Regional Youth Director (RYD) and Youth Competition Manager. If your state does not have an SYC, it should be submitted to the RYD. Contact information for SYCs and RYDs can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">here</a>.</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>The state tournament or championship must be publicly announced to local organizers and via USA Ultimate web properties at least six weeks prior to the event. Announcement must include:
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>Date(s) of event</li>
                    <li>Location of event</li>
                    <li>Contact information for event</li>
                    <li>Registration requirements</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>The state tournament must include every HS team in the state that meets the State Youth Coordinator's deadlines.
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li>In the event that there are too many in-state teams to accommodate at a state tournament, there must be a USAU qualifying event(s)* for the state tournament.</li>

                    <li>If there is a qualification process or qualifying event for one team within the state, then all teams must participate in the qualification process or appropriate qualifying events. <em>Example: If North Carolina were running Qualifying Events in Raleigh and Wilmington, then Charlotte teams must also compete in a Qualifying Event in order to be eligible for the state championship tournament.</em></li>

                    <li>The State Championship can include teams from outside of the state as long as it does not prohibit in-state teams that have met the registration requirements from participating. Additionally, both the SYC and the RYD should be made aware of this arrangement.</li>

                    <li>Teams cannot be directed to participate in a secondary event (such as a Division II or developmental division) without a Qualifying Event, unless they choose to do so.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <p>*Qualifying Events: To be considered a qualifying event, the qualifying USAU-sanctioned structure for states must be accessible for everyone to participate in it. Any questions around what is considered a qualifying event, please <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">contact</a> your RYD.</p>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Application and compliance of the above guidelines will be subject to the discretion of the State Youth Coordinator, Regional Youth Director, and USA Ultimate Manager of Competition and National Team Programs - Youth.</em></p>

        <p>All teams must submit an official 2024 State Championship roster by the deadlines outlined below. All participants must be full USAU members in good standing.

        <h4 id="hs-regisration-deadline">1. Event/Team Registration Deadline</h4>

        <ol class="lower-alpha">
            <li>All teams competing in a State Championship or Qualifying Event must be registered <strong><em>in the USAU online system (EMS)</em></strong> for the appropriate event <strong>two weeks prior to the event</strong>.

                    <li>Teams without this information registered in the online system by this deadline will be ineligible to compete.</li>

                    <li>Teams that miss the deadline may contact the Competition State Youth Coordinator to request late acceptance and are subject to a $75 late fee. Late admittance may be granted pending completion of registration steps (USAU qualified chaperone and Foundational Coach), but the SYC is not obligated to allow late teams to participate.</li>

                    <li>Registering your team in EMS requires having a chaperone and coach on the roster. Players can be rostered until one week before the event.</li>

In order to meet the event deadlines, teams must have any coaches begin the background check process no later than two weeks prior to the team registration deadline (i.e. four weeks prior to the event).</p>

        <p>*If this is the first year that a team is playing in a High School State Championship, they are <strong>exempt</strong> from this requirement. However, it is strongly encouraged that they have a coach get the high school coach certification as they will be expected to meet this requirement in the subsequent years.</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>No player, coach, or chaperone may be listed on two or more rosters at the same event (including across multiple gender or age divisions).</li>
            <li>A coach who meets chaperone requirements (over 21 years of age) can fulfill both roles on one team roster.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that all player membership dues and waivers should be submitted prior to the team registration deadline.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> A chaperone or coach's background check may expire prior to the end of the State Championship, in which case they must renew their background check prior to its expiration.</p>

        <p>There may be additional registration information required by your State Youth Coordinator. Contact your <a href="https://usaultimate.org/about/contacts/">State Youth Coordinator</a> in advance of the registration deadline for more details.</p>

        <h3>2024 USA Ultimate Youth Club Championships (August 3-5, Aurora, CO)</h3>

        <h4 id="ycc-overview">Overview</h4>

        <p>The goal of this event is to provide national-level competition for youth ultimate players and encourage local playing opportunities for youth within the USAU structure. In 2024, USA Ultimate will be accepting bids for two separate age divisions - U20 and U17. The guidelines that follow are USAU's requirements for qualification and criteria for acceptance for the USAU Youth Club Championships. As this is a growing division, these guidelines and the bid allocation process are subject to change. </p>

        <p><em>Organizations that have outstanding events open from the previous year (tournaments and/or leagues that have never been closed out with USAU) will not be considered for Phase 1.</em></p>

        <p>Second teams* within a single division from a specific organization, and international teams, may apply at any time, but their applications will not be considered until after Phase 1.</p>

        <p>The purpose of multiple bid deadlines is to accommodate organizations and teams that want to know early in the year how many bids they will receive and in which division(s). In recognizing that not all organizations are ready to bid early, Phase 2 was created to fill any vacant bids after Phase 1 and to give a second opportunity for new organizations/teams to apply.</p>

        <p><em><strong>*Note:</strong> If your organization is applying to send two boys' teams to YCC, it must also be applying to send either a girls' or a mixed team. Acceptance of a second boys' team may likely be contingent on your organization accepting the bid and fielding that girls' or mixed team.</em></p>

        <h4 id="ycc-development-proposals"><a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/youth-ultimate-development-proposal/"></a></h4>

        <p>As a part of the application process, applicants that do not meet a given criterion will be required to have a current youth club development proposal that outlines how the applicant will contribute to the development of youth ultimate in their area, and work with USAU to promote youth ultimate, over the next two years.</p>

        <p>Applicants who successfully receive a bid based on their youth club development proposal may apply for such a conditional bid for two consecutive years. </p>

        <p>IF you have not attended YCC previously, please complete the proposal and email it to the <a href="mailto:dana@hq.usaultimate.org">Youth Competition Manager</a>.</p>

        <p>After the two years from the time the proposal is accepted, if no viable USAU-sanctioned State Championship, youth club program, and/or high school league has been developed, it will be at the discretion of the Manager of Youth Competition and National Team Programs to determine whether the team can continue to apply for bids to the Youth Club Championships.</p>

        <h4 id="ycc-team-selection-process">Team Selection Process</h4>

        <p>This process is designed to encourage communities to develop both youth club playing opportunities outside of the school structure and school-based opportunities that support the USAU High School State Championship series.</p>

        <img id="ycc-bid-order-chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewlovseth/usau-guidelines/main/youth/2024-team-selection-process.jpg" alt="YCC Bid Order Chart" />

        <p><em>*At these levels, you must be running the events/leagues for the corresponding genders. For example, to receive priority in the mixed division, you must be running girls' or mixed events/leagues. Details below.</em></p>

        <p><em>**If you run a USAU sanctioned regional youth club event (see 2024 Youth Guidelines for details) instead of or in addition to a USAU sanctioned Youth Club League, this will count the same as a USAU sanctioned Youth Club League.</em></p>

        <p>In the event that two teams have equal priority status on the above diagram, the bid priority will be given to the team that has the larger number of participants in their club and high school leagues, combined.</p>

        <p>For each of the priority levels, you must meet the given criteria in a division that provides playing opportunities for players on the team requesting the bid.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Priority bid in the boys' division is dependent upon meeting these criteria in the boys' or mixed divisions in 2023 or in 2024*.</li>
            <li>Priority bid in the girls' division is dependent upon meeting these criteria in the girls' or mixed division in 2023 or in 2024*.</li>
            <li>Priority bid in the mixed division is dependent upon meeting these criteria in the girls' or mixed division in 2023 or in 2024*.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>*For 2024 events to count, the appropriate application documentation must be submitted for them before you can be awarded a bid to YCC.</p>

        <h4 id="ycc-international-teams">International Teams</h4>

        <p>International teams will be placed according to the discretion of the USA Ultimate staff.</p>

        <p>Some things that may be considered include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The number of bids available in the division</li>
            <li>Prior attendance at YCC</li>
            <li>Association with their home country's governing body for ultimate</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="ycc-bid-allocation-limits">Bid Allocation Limits</h4>

        <p>Organizations can only receive one bid per division during the Phase 1 allocations. A second bid within a division will only be considered in Phase 2 and if the division isn't full. It will also be evaluated if the organization is adhering to the expectation about fulfilling teams across gender divisions noted above.</p>

        <h4 id="ycc-league-requirements">League Requirements</h4>

        <p>For the purposes of Team Selection for YCC, leagues will be defined as follows:</p>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>USAU Youth Club or High School League - must be run within the preceding 12 months at the time of the application deadline.
                <ol class="lower-alpha">

        <h3>Competition Guidelines</h3>

        <h4 id="minors-player-info">Minor (Under 18) Player Info</h4>

        <p>Minors participating in the State Championships or Qualifying Events, Youth Club Regional Events , or YCC must have a <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/medical-authorization-form/">Medical Authorization Form</a> completed prior to participation. A team with minors on it must have one or more approved, background-checked Chaperones listed on the team's official roster.</p>

        <p><strong>The medical release form is the responsibility of the chaperone; it must be brought to each USAU event and kept on hand by the chaperone</strong>. This form will allow medical personnel to treat an injured minor without a parent/guardian having to be present. Without this form, a doctor might not be able to treat an injured minor.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A Medical Authorization is not the same as the USAU liability waiver or infectious disease waiver.</em></p>

        <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>

        <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

        <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a spirit captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials. Spirit captains should do spirit scoring with their teams after each game and are responsible for the timely submission of spirit scores.</p>

        <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

        <h4 id="school-vs-club">School-Based vs. Youth Club</h4>

        <p>For school-based events, i.e. High School and Middle School State Championships, it is expected that all students are competing with their primary full-time school where they are seeking a diploma or equivalent. If all students do not attend the same school, they must request exceptions in advance according to the guidelines of that event.</p>

        <p>For youth club events, i.e. YCC and Youth Regionals, teams may consist of any youth players within their youth region. Overall, the youth division is designed for players who are high-school aged or younger.</p>

        <h4 id="gender-division-eligibility">Gender Division Eligibility</h4>

For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern). This is in line with WFDF's Rule A, also known as the “prescribed ratio” rule described in the official <a href="https://rules.wfdf.org/documents/wfdf-rules-of-ultimate-2021-2024-appendix-v1/download" target="window">WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024 – APPENDIX v1.0.</a></li>
                            <li>In addition to Rule A, whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group will need to pull. For example, if there are 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their woman-matching players must pull the disc to start the point and vice versa.</li>

        <h4 id="violations-and-sanctions">Violations and Sanctions</h4>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of the Competition Guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.</p>

        <p>In order to help teams follow the Competition Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to youth competition. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding information. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the competition, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and because it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully, and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>

        <p><em>Application and compliance of the above guidelines will be subject to the discretion of the USA Ultimate Manager of Competition and National Team Programs - Youth.</em></p>
