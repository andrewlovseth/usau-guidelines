            The <strong>Youth Club Division</strong> is designed to include as many players as possible who have not yet
            completed the high school (HS) phase of life, while also maintaining consistent age-based cutoffs (under-20
            and under-17) that allow for fair competition. During the summer, we extend the high school phase to include
            players who have just recently graduated from high school in the past few months.

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>
                The personnel ratio for the mixed division of the Youth Club Championships and Regionals will be 4:3 (4
                man-matching players and 3 woman-matching players, or 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching
                players), adhering to WFDF Rule A:

                        These games will also have an additional disc flip after the initial flip, where the winner will
                        decide the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points, the ratio must
                        be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points, the ratio must be the same
                        as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end
                        of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern). This is in line with WFDF’s Rule A, also
                        known as the “prescribed ratio” rule described in the official
                        <a href="https://rules.wfdf.sport/resources/" target="window"

                        a player of that gender-matching group will need to pull. For example, if there are 4
                        woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their
                        woman-matching players must pull the disc to start the point and vice versa.

                with fewer than 7 players, matching the personnel gender-matching ratio with as many players as
                possible.

            USA Ultimate is looking for organizations to help us expand the regional youth club competition structure.
            These events bring together teams from different areas, ideally from within the host region, to compete
            against one another. These regional events should typically be much more accessible than Youth Club
            Championships (YCC), and these regional events should also allow for inclusion of younger age divisions than
            YCC (e.g. U15 or younger). These tournaments will serve three major functions by providing:

        <h4 id="ycc-overview">Overview</h4>

        <p>
            The goal of this event is to provide national-level competition for youth ultimate players and encourage
            local playing opportunities for youth within the USAU structure. In 2026, USA Ultimate will be hosting
            divisions for two separate age divisions – Under-20 and Under-17.&nbsp;The guidelines that follow are USAU’s
            requirements for qualification and criteria for acceptance for the USAU Youth Club Championships. As this is
            a growing and emerging division, these guidelines and the tier placement process are subject to change each
            year.&nbsp;

        <p>
            In shifting the team notification ahead to the fall rather than winter/early spring, USA Ultimate encourages
            programs to take advantage of the extra time to form teams, in order for students, coaches and support staff
            to be able to appropriately prevent and plan around any conflicts which might not allow them to attend
            YCCs.&nbsp; USA Ultimate encourages programs to consider running team tryouts in the fall, at least for a
            critical core of players (perhaps the YCC minimum rostered number) with room to add more at a later stage,
            even if the team does not start practicing until the following spring or summer.&nbsp; Hopefully this will
            provide more existential stability for teams as well as for team’s rosters or roster cores.&nbsp; Official
            final rosters will still have a due date in mid-July, only a few weeks before the event.&nbsp; Programs that
            hold tryouts in the fall could reserve a few spots for “late bloomers” to be added to the team in the spring
            or early summer.
        </p>

        <p>
            After May 1st, new teams and <strong>international teams</strong> may apply.&nbsp; These teams will be
            admitted on a first come - first served basis, based on field space and scheduling capacity.

        <h3>Team Bid Allocation Limits and Gender Balancing</h3>

        <p>
            With the goal of accepting all teams that want to attend YCCs in some tier for their age-gender division,
            there is also an ongoing goal to increase the number of girls division teams, which have historically been
            far fewer than boys division teams hosted by YCC events.
        </p>

        <p>
            For an LDO to send a second team (a.k.a, “B-team”) in a boys gender division in either U-20 or U-17 age
            groups, that LDO must also send at least one girls division team in either age group.
        </p>

        <p>For every additional boys division team, the LDO must send an additional girls division team.</p>

        <p>
            All additional teams in the mixed division &amp; girls divisions will be accepted without any additional
            requirements.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="ycc-team-tier-placement-process">
        <h3>Team Tier Placement Process</h3>

        <p>
            The process is designed to encourage communities to develop both youth club playing opportunities, outside
            of the school structure, as well as school-based opportunities that support the USAU High School State
            Championships.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the past (from 2005 through Aug 2025), team acceptance to YCC was entirely based on growth and
            sanctioning metrics for the local disc organizations (LDOs) that sponsored each team.&nbsp; In 2026, the
            goal will be to accept all interested teams.&nbsp; In any age-gender division with 24 or more interested
            teams, the division will be separated into two tiers: DI (upper) and DII (lower).&nbsp; Age-gender divisions
            with DI and DII tiers will use the Points Chart (see section below) to determine team tier placements.&nbsp;
        </p>

            The points system is designed to offer approximately ⅔ of the achievable points based on a team’s final
            placement at the previous YCC (team competition results/strength) and ⅓ of the achievable points based on
            local &amp; state growth/program factors (as supported directly by each team’s supporting LDO and home
            state). While it is a goal for YCC to showcase the highest level of youth ultimate competition, it also a
            goal for the event to showcase and reward LDOs that promote &amp; encourage growth and accessibility of the
            sport for youth locally, in order to increase the overall number of players at all levels, not just those
            with the time, resources and commitment levels to attend national-level travel events.
        </p>

        <p>
            Achieving the maximum growth/activity points is designed to be a relatively high bar that only a few states
            and organizations typically reach.&nbsp; Most organizations are likely to be already operating programs that
            earn growth points, and those who are not should be able to make relatively small and/or modest changes to
            begin earning growth points.

                New teams will be placed into DII for their first year and then have an opportunity to move up in the

                        and will only gain access to DI if fewer than 16 total LDOs accept DI placement (or if fewer
                        than 24 total teams register for the division).

            Teams that place 1st through 3rd in DII will earn more competition points than those that place 11th through
            16th in DI, in order to increase the likelihood that they will be offered DI in the following year.

        <p>
            If every team earns the same number of growth points (i.e., looking only at competition points), 3 teams
            would move from DII to DI (and 3 teams would move from DI to DII):

                If an interested team only missed 2025 YCC, they would receive 75% of the competitive points for their

            </li>
            <li>
                If they missed 2025 &amp; 2024 YCCs, they would receive 50% of the competitive points for their 2023 YCC
                placement.
            </li>
            <li>
                If they missed 2023-25 YCC, they would receive 25% of the competitive points for their 2022 YCC

            </li>
            <li>
                If a team has missed more than 3 years immediately preceding the event year being placed, then no

    <section class="guidelines-section" id="ycc-future-growth-percentages">
        <h3>Future Growth Percentages</h3>

        <p>
            The “Future growth %” column indicated in the chart will not be used for 2026 YCC tier placement, but is
            planned for use in subsequent years. Growth activity that is reported and verified for Sep 2024 - Aug 2025
            will be used as a comparative baseline for determining percentages in the subsequent years’ data
            aggregation.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
            In future years, for any states or LDOs with no activity in a category in the previous year, no growth will
            be possible in the subsequent year (with zero as the previous year denominator) until they establish that
            activity as a new baseline. For example, if a state has no USAU State Championship in Fall 2024 - Spring
            2025, and then host a USAU State Championship in Spring 2026 with 4 teams, they will not be considered to
            have grown by any fixed percentage (having gone from 0 to 4 teams). But if the subsequent Spring 2027 State
            Championship has 6 teams, then they would have 50% growth indicated. This will apply to LDO’s
            USAU-sanctioned events also. We will use Sep 2024 - Aug 25 activity as a growth baseline for Sep 2025
            -&nbsp; Aug 2026.

                        their YCC teams, only one LDO may receive the credit towards the points system, and that
                        determination for which LDO should be agreed upon between all of the LDOs who are co-hosting
