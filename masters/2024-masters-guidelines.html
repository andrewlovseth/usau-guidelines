        <h3>I. Overview</h3>

        <p>The Masters Division - which includes the following divisions: Great Grand Masters Men's, Great Grand Masters Women's, Grand Masters Men's, Grand Masters Mixed, Grand Masters Women's, Masters Men's, Masters Mixed and Masters Women's - will have specific competition, eligibility and geographic guidelines. USA Ultimate recognizes that each division has unique differences at this time and will adjust guidelines to best fit each division. As the sport of ultimate continues to grow, the Masters Division will need to continue to evolve to accommodate new age divisions. <strong>For 2024 the following changes will be in effect for the Series.</strong></p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Event Scaling: The size of divisions at the Masters National Championships will be based on the number of teams that meet the team registration deadline. *USAU will award up to 100 bids to the National Championship Event across the 8 divisions.</li>

            <li>If there are 4 or more teams in a divisionâ€™s Super-Regional event, all teams will be required to compete regardless of how many bids they have to Nationals.</li>

            <li>Women's Masters out-of-region player maximums will be reduced from 10 to 7.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>USA Ultimate is considering additional changes for future Masters Division seasons. The following will NOT be in effect for 2024, but are being considered for 2025 and beyond.</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>USA Ultimate will review minimum age requirements to align with WFDF guidelines.</li>

            <li>As divisions continue to grow, and to accommodate a full field of teams, USA Ultimate may explore expanding the National Championship Event.</li>

                <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>
                <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

                <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each playerâ€™s responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a spirit captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials. Spirit captains should do spirit scoring with their teams after each game and are responsible for the timely submission of spirit scores.</p>

                <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

                <p>A team must play all its games at a "qualifying" tournament in order to qualify for the next tournament in the Masters Series.</p>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>A team that forfeits a Masters Series game, and every player on that team's event roster, is disqualified for the remainder of the current series, in every division.</li>

                    <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                    <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below five (5) players.</li>

                    <li>At the discretion of the event's USA Ultimate coordinator, consideration may be given to situations that might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of the competition. Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.</li>

                    <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed at a rate of one (1) point per five (5) minutes. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will technically forfeit the game.</li>

                    <li>The list of allowable forfeit scenarios is found in the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/USAU_TournamentFormats.pdf">formats manual</a>.</li>

                    <li>At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the personnel ratio for the first point.

        <h3>VI. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of these guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate <a href="mailto:ReportConcern@usaultimate.org">conduct process</a>. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.</p>

        <p>In order to help teams follow the Masters Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Masters Championships. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding masters information. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the Masters Championships, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition and because it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
