        <h3>I. Overview</h3>

        <p>
            The Masters Division - which includes the following divisions: Great Grand Masters Men's, Great Grand Masters Women's, Grand Masters Men's, Grand Masters Mixed, Grand Masters Women's, Masters Men's, Masters Mixed and Masters Women's - will have specific competition, eligibility and geographic guidelines. USA Ultimate recognizes that each division has unique differences at this time and
            will adjust guidelines to best fit each division. As the sport of ultimate continues to grow, the Masters Division will need to continue to evolve to accommodate new age divisions. <strong>For 2025 the following changes will be in effect for the Series.</strong>
        </p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>USA Ultimate has updated the minimum age requirements for Great Grand Masters to align with WFDF guidelines: 48 for men, 45 for women, non-binary and players who prefer to self-report their gender identity.</li>

            <li>Terminology of Super Regionals will be changed to Super-Qualifiers.</li>

            <li>Southern Ontario has been moved from the Northeast Region to the Great Lakes Region. This is to bring consistency with the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/club/guidelines-and-registration/club-sections/#top">Club Division Regions</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>USA Ultimate is considering additional changes for future Masters Division seasons. The following will NOT be in effect for 2025, but are being considered for 2026 and beyond.</p>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>USA Ultimate may consider setting out of region roster limits for the Women's Great Grand Masters division</li>

            <li>If USA Ultimate can expand the capacity of the National Championship Event, we will explore additional age divisions</li>

                <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>
                <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

                <p>
                    All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a spirit captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at
                    any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials. Spirit captains should do spirit scoring with their teams after each game and are responsible for the timely submission of spirit scores.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally
                    bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.

                        <strong>Determing the ratio</strong> - <strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “prescribed ratio” rule (also known as Rule A in the official WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024 - APPENDIX v1.0):<br /><br />

                        <em>Ratio Rule A (“prescribed ratio” rule):</em><br />
                        At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the gender ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats
                        until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>All Mixed games</strong> will use the “majority pull” rule”. Each point, a player representing the gender match-up with four players on the field must pull for that point. That is, if there are four women-matching players a woman-matching player must pull.</li>

                    <li><strong>For all Mixed games</strong>, if a team cannot match the on-field personnel ratio of all seven players on the team determining the personnel ratio for the point, then it must play with fewer than seven players, but no less than 5, matching the personnel ratio with as many players as possible.</li>

                                Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the majority pull rule will be handled the same as an offsides violation/false start violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling “offsides,” a player should call “majority pull violation.” Like with offsides violations, after the first majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as
                                described in 9.B.4.d.2. Majority pull rule violations accumulate separately from offsides/false start violations. In games with observers, either the observer or a player on the field may call the violation.

                        <strong>Substitutions</strong><br />
                        Player substitutions can be completed only:

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>after a goal and before the substituting team has signaled readiness; or</li>

                            <li>
                                to replace injured players, replace players with illegal equipment (7.D.3), to resolve an incorrect personnel violation (9.B.3.a), or to replace a player removed due to misconduct (2.C.2, Appendix B). In this case, the opposing team may substitute a like number of, or fewer, players. In the Mixed Division a substituting player must be of the same gender match as the
                                player they are replacing.<br />

                                    >For additional clarity with regards to substitutions in the Mixed Division:<br />

                                    1. The player replacing the player must be of the same gender match as the player they are replacing. (e.g. if this team substitutes a WMP, a WMP must replace that player)<br />

                                    2. The opposing team may substitute a like number or fewer players. The gender match of these players does not need to match the sub made by the injured team.<br />

                                    For example: A single WMP is injured and replaced by Team A.<br />

                                    Team B may:<br />
                                    - Substitute a WMP with another WMP<br />
                                    - Substitute a MMP with another MMP<br />
                                    - Choose not to make a substitution</em
                                >

                        <strong>Gender Matchups:</strong> In Mixed, nonbinary, trans, and gender-diverse players can change their matchup as often as every point, though not during a point (e.g. injury substitution, ratio violation). Once a matchup is chosen, that matchup will count towards that ratio for the duration of that point.

                            <li>USA Ultimate expects that players who change their matchup during the season, including during a game, are doing so for gender-affirming purposes, and not for the purposes of gaining an on-field advantage. Those who are found to be changing matchup purely for purposes of competitive advantage will be subject to sanctions.</li>

        <h3>VI. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of these guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.</p>

        <p>
            In order to help teams follow the Masters Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Masters Championships. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding masters
            information. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the Masters Championships, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition and because it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an
            incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.
