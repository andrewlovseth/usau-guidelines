                <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>
                <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

                <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount.</p>

                <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

                <p>All Divisions will be required to host regional events if the division has more teams than bids to the USA Ultimate Masters Championships at the conclusion of the Team Registration Deadline.</p>

                <p>In response to player feedback, USA Ultimate will transition to an inter-regional format to encourage meaningful and competitive qualifying events. To facilitate this, two (2) regions will be paired together for Regional Championships.</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                <p> In 2023, Southwest, North Central, Southeast, and Northeast will host Masters Men's, Masters Women's, Masters Mixed Regional Qualifiers</p>

                <p> In 2023, Northwest, South Central, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic will host Grand Masters Men's, Women's and Mixed and Great Grand Masters Regional Qualifiers.</p>

                <p> In 2024, Northwest, South Central, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic will host Masters Men's, Masters Women's, Masters Mixed Regional Qualifiers.</p>

                <p> In 2024, Southwest, North Central, Southeast, and Northeast will host Grand Masters Men's, Women's and Mixed and Great Grand Masters Regional Qualifiers.</p>

                <p> Regions will alternate which divisions they host each year.</p>

                <p><strong><em> If a division has six (6) or more teams in both regions, inter-regional competition will not occur. That division will hold their regional qualifying event in their home region.</em></strong></p>

                <h4 id="forfeit-rule">Forfeit Rule</h4>
                <p>A team must play all its games at a "qualifying" tournament in order to qualify for the next tournament in the Masters Series.</p>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>A team that forfeits a Masters Series game, and every player on that team's event roster, is disqualified for the remainder of the current series, in every division.</li>

                    <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                    <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below five (5) players.</li>

                    <li>At the discretion of the event's USA Ultimate coordinator, consideration may be given to situations that might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of the competition. Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.</li>

                    <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed at a rate of one (1) point per five (5) minutes. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will technically forfeit the game.</li>

                    <li>The list of allowable forfeit scenarios is found in the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/USAU_TournamentFormats.pdf">formats manual</a>.</li>

                <p><strong>In their USA Ultimate membership account, every athlete should select the gender identity option that best aligns with their gender identity. When registering for a USA Ultimate sanctioned or championship series event, athletes should select to participate in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe based on their indicated gender identity.</strong></p>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Players who select <strong>Man</strong> (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in men's divisions or as a man-matching player in mixed divisions.</li>
                    <li>Players who select <strong>Woman</strong> (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in men's or women's divisions, or as a woman-matching player in mixed divisions.</li>
                    <li>Players who select the <strong>Non-Binary</strong> or <strong>Prefer to Self-Report </strong>gender identity option are eligible to compete in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe, as per <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/USA-Ultimate-Gender-Inclusion-Policy-Approved-11.18.2020.pdf">USA Ultimate's Gender Inclusion Policy</a> <em>(approved 11.2020)</em>.</li>

                <p>On-field personnel ratio rules for the mixed division are described below in the On-field Personnel Ratio for Mixed Division section.</p>

            </li>

            <li class="h4-header">
                <h4 id="ratio">On-field Personnel Ratio for Mixed Division</h4>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>The personnel ratio on the field at all times for the masters mixed division will be 4/3 (four man-matching players and three woman-matching players or four woman-matching players and three man-matching players).</li>

                    <li>At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).</li>

                    <li>If a team cannot match the entire seven-player personnel ratio of the opposing team for the point, then it must play with fewer than seven players, matching the personnel ratio with as many players as possible.</li>

                    <li>
                        Injury timeouts
                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>In the event of an injury timeout where a player leaves the field, the replacing player must maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the injured player.</li>

                            <li>
                                If a team replaces players, the opposing team has the option of substituting a like number of, or fewer, players.
                                <ol class="lower-numeral">
                                    <li>The replacing player(s) must maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the player(s) they replace.</li>
                                    <li>If a team calls an injury timeout but does not have a replacement player to maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the injured player, it may not replace that player and must play fewer than seven (7) players.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                    </li>

                    <li>Pull Rule: Whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group must pull. For example, if there are 4 woman-matching players and 3 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their woman-matching players must pull the disc to start the point and vice versa.</li>

        <h3>VI. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of these guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate <a href="mailto:ReportConcern@usaultimate.org">conduct process</a>. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition.</p>

        <p>In order to help teams follow the Masters Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Masters Championships. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for following procedures and understanding masters information. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the Masters Championships, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition and because it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
