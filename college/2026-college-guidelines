                    <li><strong>Timeline</strong> - The official USA Ultimate College Regular Season will run from January 1, 2026 through March 29, 2026.</li>

                    <li><strong>Regular Season Games</strong> - The results of games between rostered college teams at USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season events will count towards the Official USA Ultimate College Rankings. USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season event organizers will be responsible for submitting or verifying the results of games between rostered college teams at their events through USA Ultimate's online score reporting system.</li>

                    <li><strong>Eligibility and Roster Verification</strong> - College teams at USA Ultimate-sanctioned Regular Season events will be required to submit their roster of participating players to the event organizer through the USA Ultimate online rostering system by 5:00pm Wednesday before the event. College teams participating in regular season games will be expected to do so only with players who meet, or who will meet, the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2026-College-Eligibility-Guidelines.pdf" target="window">USA Ultimate College Eligibility Rules</a> for the USA Ultimate College Series.</li>

                    <li><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong> - Teams will need to have participated in a minimum of 10 regular season games to be included in the Official USA Ultimate College Rankings and impact bid allocation.</li>

                    <li><strong>College Series Requirements </strong> - Participation in the USA Ultimate College Regular Season is <strong>not</strong> a prerequisite for USA Ultimate College Series participation.</li>

                    <li><strong>Official USA Ultimate College Rankings</strong> - Following their initial release, the rankings will be updated weekly throughout the USA Ultimate College Regular Season, after which the results will be used to determine strength bid allocations for Conferences to Regionals, and for Regions to the USA Ultimate College Championships. For D-III eligible schools, the rankings algorithm will also be used to determine strength bid allocations to D-III Regionals and the USA Ultimate D-III College Championships. Should a D-III team that factored into the strength bid allocation process subsequently choose to pursue D-I regionals, the associated bid will be reallocated based on the waitlist.</li>

                            <li>The algorithm will be run and published weekly starting in March, although all rankings are tentative pending eligibility verification. At the end of the regular season, adjustments as to which game results will count will be made and the final rankings will be published.</li>

                            <li>Teams will need to have participated in a minimum of 10 regular season games to be included in the final Official USA Ultimate College Rankings and impact bid allocation. <strong>Participation in the USA Ultimate College Regular Season is not a prerequisite for USA Ultimate College Series participation.</strong></li>

                            <li><strong>X/Y teams / split squads</strong> - A team is not allowed to split into two separate teams for the purpose of participating in the same tournament together or at separate tournaments occurring at the same time. If a team is splitting for the purpose of try outs, the alternative would be to utilize an A/B/C team structure. If a tournament is in need of another team, the tournament organizer must find an additional team rather than split an existing team into multiple teams.<br />
							We expect that teams attending regular season events are possible teams that may potentially play in the postseason. Teams may not create a separate named team for regular season events that is a subset of their intended legitimate team for the sole purpose of avoiding those results to count for their team.</li>

                            <li><strong>A/B/C team movement</strong> - Player eligibility for all teams from a school will be verified without respect to A/B/C team affiliation, in order to allow teams to make final A/B/C team determinations until Wednesday, March 25. Reasonable movement of such players during the regular season is acceptable. However, deliberate mis-designation of a group of players at an event will be considered a roster violation and may be subject to ramifications as outlined in the section, “Violations and Sanctions”. If such deliberate mis-designation of players is discovered, USA Ultimate reserves the right to assign a game result to whichever team it deems appropriate.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disallow regular season results for reasons not outlined in these guidelines, if they are determined not to be in line with the goals of the USA Ultimate College Season or the mission and policies of USA Ultimate.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season event organizers will be responsible for submitting or verifying the results of games between rostered college teams at their events through USA Ultimate's online score reporting system.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forfeit Rule (Regular Season)</strong> - As a general rule, USA Ultimate prohibits the forfeiting of scheduled games during the regular season. <strong>In 2024 we introduced a power ranking penalty of 60 points will be assessed to teams who forfeit regular season games (see Sanctions and Exceptions, below).</strong><br/><br/>
                        
                    Teams are expected to play out their entire schedule of games at events they have chosen to enter. The competition format of an event and the season as a whole rely on scheduled games being played.

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, plays in a manner indicative of intent to lose or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games and all following games in the tournament. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game in which the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums below.</li>

                            <li>Teams that withdraw from an event 7 days or less of the event without approval from the Tournament Director and USAU HQ may be subject to the sanctions described in Part e. In the event of a withdrawal, Tournament Directors or teams negatively impacted by the withdrawal can report a violation to USA Ultimate HQ  (<a href="mailto:matthew@hq.usaultimate.org">matthew@hq.usaultimate.org</a>).</li>

                            <li><strong>Sanctions</strong> - USA Ultimate reserves the right to sanction teams that forfeit games during the regular season (examples include disqualification from season and/or series, bid allocation penalties, team and/or player/coach suspensions).<br/><br/>
                            
                            <strong>For each forfeited game, a 60-point power rating penalty will be assessed to forfeiting team(s).</strong> This will be applied to the Final Regular Season Rankings.  See exceptions below for an appeal process.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Exceptions</strong> - The safety of athletes is a top priority and must be considered when determining whether a game should be played and under what conditions. This includes following COVID-19 protocols, and adherence to both university and location safety regulations.<br/><br/>

                                Game forfeit appeals can be sent to the College Manager (<a href="mailto:matthew@hq.usaultimate.org">matthew@hq.usaultimate.org</a>), with <strong>exceptions given on a case by case basis (limited to health and safety risks, or other verifiable logistical challenges).</strong>

                        <strong>Spirit of the Game</strong> - Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.<br/><br/>

                        All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a Spirit Captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials.<br/><br/>

                        It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.<br/><br/>

                                    <li><strong>Team Strength bids</strong> - six team strength bids will be awarded. The highest ranked D-III qualifying team in the rankings that has not yet been awarded a bid will have their Region receive a team strength bid to D-III College Championships. Bids will continue to be awarded in this manner until all bids have been awarded.<br /><br />

                                        If a team that is involved in the allocation process of a D-III strength bid chooses to participate in D-I regionals instead of D-III, that bid will be reallocated to the home region of the next highest ranked team.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Bid cap</strong> - no D-III region can receive more than four bids to the D-III College Championships.</li>

                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Unaccepted Bids</strong> - in the event a bid is declined by a team, that bid will be awarded to the next region on the strength bid waitlist, unless the declined bid is an automatic bid, in which case it will remain in the region. Should a team be disqualified from accepting a bid, the vacated bid will stay in region and be awarded to the next highest finisher at that Regional event. </li>

                            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field, will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>At the discretion of the event's regional director, in consultation with the National Director, consideration may be given to situations that might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of the competition.</li>

                            <li>Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.</li>

                            <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will technically forfeit the game.</li>

        <h3>IV. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of the college guidelines may result in sanctions on individuals or teams by the College Working Group, or through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the college season, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and because it is often difficult to determine intent, <strong>guideline violations will result in serious repercussions</strong>. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
