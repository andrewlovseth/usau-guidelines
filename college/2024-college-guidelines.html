                    <li><strong>Regular Season Games </strong> - The results of games between rostered college teams at USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season events will count towards the Official USA Ultimate College Rankings. USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season event organizers will be responsible for submitting or verifying the results of games between rostered college teams at their events through USA Ultimate's online score reporting system.</li>

                    <li><strong>Eligibility and Roster Verification</strong> - College teams at USA Ultimate-sanctioned Regular Season events will be required to submit their roster of participating players to the event organizer through the USA Ultimate online rostering system by 5:00pm Wednesday before the event.

                    <li><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong> - Teams will need to have participated in a minimum of 10 regular season games to be included in the Official USA Ultimate College Rankings and impact bid allocation.</li>

                    <li><strong>Official USA Ultimate College Rankings</strong> - Following their initial release, the rankings will be updated weekly throughout the USA Ultimate College Regular Season, after which the results will be used to determine strength bid allocations for Conferences to Regionals, and for Regions to the USA Ultimate College Championships. For D-III eligible schools, the rankings algorithm will also be used to determine strength bid allocations to D-III Regionals and the USA Ultimate D-III College Championships. Should a D-III team that factored into the strength bid allocation process subsequently choose to pursue D-I regionals, the associated bid will be reallocated based on the waitlist.</li>

                            <li>The algorithm will be run and published weekly starting in March, although all rankings are tentative pending eligibility verification.

                            <li>If a team plays with a legitimate roster against a college team that is determined after the fact to have not had a roster of eligible players at that event, the game <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> count towards the eligible team's 10 game minimum for inclusion in the rankings. </li>

                            <li>If a team has a player who becomes academically ineligible mid-way through the season, games prior to the player becoming ineligible may still count, provided that this can be established definitively by the team.

                            <li><strong>X/Y teams / split squads</strong> - A team is not allowed to split into two separate teams for the purpose of participating in the same tournament together or at separate tournaments occurring at the same time. If a team is splitting for the purpose of try outs, the alternative would be to utilize an A/B/C team structure. If a tournament is in need of another team, the tournament organizer must find an additional team rather than split an existing team into multiple teams.</li>

                            <li><strong>A/B/C team movement</strong> - Player eligibility for all teams from a school will be verified without respect to A/B/C team affiliation, in order to allow teams to make final A/B/C team determinations until Monday, March 25. Reasonable movement of such players during the regular season is acceptable. However, deliberate mis-designation of a group of players at an event will be considered a roster violation and may be subject to ramifications as outlined in the section, “Violations and Sanctions”. If such deliberate mis-designation of players is discovered, USA Ultimate reserves the right to assign a game result to whichever team it deems appropriate.</li>

                            <li>Each game must be, at minimum, to 11 points and 60 minutes in length.

                                <ol class="lower-numeral">
                                    <li>Games that are suspended due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reason will be counted only if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total or half the minimum game length.</li>

                    <li><strong>Sanctioned Match Play</strong> - Individual games may be <a href="https://usaultimate.org/sanctioning/" target="window">sanctioned</a> at the discretion of USA Ultimate in order to provide flexibility for teams in planning their seasons and scheduling playing opportunities.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disallow regular season results for reasons not outlined in these guidelines, if they are determined not to be in line with the goals of the USA Ultimate College Season or the mission and policies of USA Ultimate.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season event organizers will be responsible for submitting or verifying the results of games between rostered college teams at their events through USA Ultimate's online score reporting system.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forfeit Rule (Regular Season)</strong> - As a general rule, USA Ultimate prohibits the forfeiting of scheduled games during the regular season. <strong>New to 2024: a power ranking penalty of 60 points will be assessed to teams who forfeit regular season games (see Sanctions and Exceptions, below).</strong><br/><br/>
                        
                    Teams are expected to play out their entire schedule of games at events they have chosen to enter. The competition format of an event and the season as a whole rely on scheduled games being played.

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, plays in a manner indicative of intent to lose or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games and all following games in the tournament. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game in which the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums below.</li>

                            <li>Teams that withdraw from an event 7 days or less of the event without approval from the Tournament Director and USAU HQ may be subject to the sanctions described in Part e. In the event of a withdrawal, Tournament Directors or teams negatively impacted by the withdrawal can report a violation to USA Ultimate HQ  (<a href="mailto:matthew@hq.usaultimate.org">matthew@hq.usaultimate.org</a>).</li>


                            <li><strong>Sanctions</strong> - USA Ultimate reserves the right to sanction teams that forfeit games during the regular season (examples include disqualification from season and/or series, bid allocation penalties, team and/or player/coach suspensions).<br/><br/>
                            
                            <strong>For each forfeited game, a 60-point power rating penalty will be assessed to forfeiting team(s).</strong> This will be applied to the Final Regular Season Rankings.  See exceptions below for an appeal process.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Exceptions</strong> - The safety of athletes is a top priority and must be considered when determining whether a game should be played and under what conditions. This includes following COVID-19 protocols, and adherence to both university and location safety regulations.<br/><br/>

                                Game forfeit appeals can be sent to the College Manager (<a href="mailto:matthew@hq.usaultimate.org">matthew@hq.usaultimate.org</a>), with <strong>exceptions given on a case by case basis (limited to health and safety risks, or other verifiable logistical challenges).</strong>

Please note that this process is not for teams that missed the Roster Deadline; this only applies to individual players who require additional clarification (i.e. a player who is on the registrar-verified roster, but due to registrar error, was not signed off on properly) or who are omitted from a team roster that has otherwise been properly submitted. <strong>The deadline for submitting a Player Appeal Form</strong> (including registrar-verified materials or any other requested documentation) is <strong>5pm MT Friday March 14, 2024</strong> (received at headquarters, not postmarked, by 5pm MT March 15).

                        <strong>Spirit of the Game</strong> - Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.<br/><br/>

                        All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a Spirit Captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials.<br/><br/>

                        It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.<br/><br/>

                                    <li>Developmental Conferences events will be determined between the March 1 roster deadline and the March 25 team registration deadline and require that there are at least 6 registered 2nd/3rd/etc. teams at D-I schools.

Notwithstanding section iv above, a D-III team can choose to participate at their D-I conference event if they have participated at their D-I regional event for each of the previous three years.

                            <li>a.	A team must play all of its games at a "qualifying" tournament in order to qualify for the next tournament in the series. This includes all women's division teams in regions that meet the Regional Event Scaling guideline found in Section 4.a.i.</li>

                            <li>A team must start its first game in the series with 7 players and play each point with at least 6 players.</li>

                            <li>A team that forfeits a series game, and every player on that team's roster, is disqualified for the remainder of the current series.</li>

                            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field, will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>At the discretion of the event's regional director, in consultation with the National Director, consideration may be given to situations that might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of the competition.</li>

                            <li>Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.</li>

                            <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will technically forfeit the game.</li>

                            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums above.</li>

        <h3>IV. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of the college guidelines may result in sanctions on individuals or teams by the College Working Group, or through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the college season, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and because it is often difficult to determine intent, <strong>guideline violations will result in serious repercussions</strong>. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
