                    <li><strong>Official USA Ultimate College Rankings</strong> - Following their initial release, the rankings will be updated weekly throughout the USA Ultimate College Regular Season, after which the results will be used to determine strength bid allocations for Conferences to Regionals, and for Regions to the USA Ultimate College Championships. For Division III eligible schools, the rankings algorithm will also be used to determine strength bid allocations to D-III Regionals and the USA Ultimate Division III College Championships. Should a Division III team that factored into the strength bid allocation process subsequently choose to pursue Division I regionals, the associated bid will be reallocated based on the waitlist. </li>

                            <li>The algorithm will be run and published weekly starting in March, although all rankings are tentative pending eligibility verification. At the end of the regular season, adjustments as to which game results will count will be made and the final rankings will be published.</li>

                            <li>Teams will need to have participated in a minimum of 10 regular season games to be included in the final Official USA Ultimate College Rankings and impact bid allocation.

                            <li>If a team has a player who becomes academically ineligible mid-way through the season, games prior to the player becoming ineligible may still count, provided that this can be established definitively by the team.

                            <li><strong>X/Y teams / split squads</strong> - A team is not allowed to split into two separate teams for the purpose of participating in the same tournament together or at separate tournaments occurring at the same time. If a team is splitting for the purpose of try outs, the alternative would be to utilize an A/B/C team structure. If a tournament is in need of another team, the tournament organizer must find an additional team rather than split an existing team into multiple teams.</li>

                            <li><strong>A/B/C team movement</strong> - Player eligibility for all teams from a school will be verified without respect to A/B/C team affiliation, in order to allow teams to make final A/B/C team determinations until Monday, March 27. Reasonable movement of such players during the regular season is acceptable. However, deliberate mis-designation of a group of players at an event will be considered a roster violation and may be subject to ramifications as outlined in the section, “Violations and Sanctions”. If such deliberate mis-designation of players is discovered, USA Ultimate reserves the right to assign a game result to whichever team it deems appropriate.</li>

                                    <li>Games that are suspended due to inclement weather or other unavoidable reason will be counted only if a team has reached at least half the minimum point total or half the minimum game length.</li>

                    <li><strong>Sanctioned Match Play</strong> - Individual games may be sanctioned at the discretion of USA Ultimate in order to provide flexibility for teams in planning their seasons and scheduling playing opportunities. <a href="https://usaultimate.org/sanctioning/" target="window">Click here</a> for more information on event sanctioning and requirements. </li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disallow regular season results for reasons not outlined in these guidelines, if they are determined not to be in line with the goals of the USA Ultimate College Season or the mission and policies of USA Ultimate.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate-sanctioned College Regular Season event organizers will be responsible for submitting or verifying the results of games between rostered college teams at their events through USA Ultimate's online score reporting system.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forfeit Rule (Regular Season)</strong> - As a general rule, USA Ultimate prohibits the forfeiting of scheduled games during the regular season. Teams are expected to play out their entire schedule of games at events they have chosen to enter. The competition format of an event and the season as a whole rely on scheduled games being played.

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, plays in a manner indicative of intent to lose or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field will forfeit those games and all following games in the tournament. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums below. </li>

                            <li>Teams that withdraw from an event 7 days or less of the event without approval from the Tournament Director and USAU HQ may be subject to the sanctions described in Part e. In the event of a withdrawal, Tournament Directors or teams negatively impacted by the withdrawal can report a violation to USA Ultimate HQ (<a href="mailto:ben@hq.usaultimate.org">ben@hq.usaultimate.org</a> or <a href="mailto:leah@hq.usaultimate.org"></a>leah@hq.usaultimate.org</a>). </li>

                            <li><strong>Exceptions</strong> - The safety of athletes is a top priority and must be considered when determining whether a game should be played and under what conditions. This includes following COVID-19 protocols, contact tracing, and adherence to both university and location safety regulations.</li>

                            <li><strong>Sanctions</strong> - USA Ultimate reserves the right to sanction teams that forfeit games during the regular season (examples include disqualification from season and/or series, bid allocation penalties, team and/or player/coach suspensions). Game forfeits will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</li>

USA Ultimate membership dues and individual waivers must also be submitted by the deadline to add players to your Conference event roster, although due to the processing time, it is advisable to submit membership dues and waivers with the roster prior to the March 3 Roster Deadline to ensure that players are listed as paid and waivered in time for the Series.

Please note that this process is not for teams that missed the Roster Deadline; this only applies to individual players who require additional clarification (i.e. a player who is on the registrar-verified roster, but due to registrar error, was not signed off on properly) or who are omitted from a team roster that has otherwise been properly submitted. The deadline for submitting a Player Appeal Form (including registrar-verified materials or any other requested documentation) is <strong>5pm MT Friday March 10, 2023</strong> (received at headquarters, not postmarked, by 5pm MT March 10).

                <ol class="numeral">
                    <li><strong>Spirit of the Game</strong> - Ultimate has traditionally relied upon a spirit of sportsmanship which places the responsibility for fair play on the players themselves. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of the bond of mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play. Protection of these vital elements serves to eliminate adverse conduct from the Ultimate field. Such actions as taunting of opposing players, dangerous aggression, intentional fouling, or other 'win at all costs' behavior are contrary to the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided by all players. Spirit of the Game sets Ultimate apart from other competitive team sports. The organizational challenge for the USA Ultimate is to foster an environment where the challenge does not become, "to see what I can get away with". For 40 years, Ultimate has flourished, reaching a highly competitive level, without the use of referees. In Ultimate, the honor system works. Sure, human nature rears its ugly head from time to time - just as in any sport, just as in life. Yet, one of the many beauties of Ultimate is how, even amid the most difficult of situations, utmost graciousness is allowed to meet that challenge head on. Through this balance, Ultimate players are free to demonstrate the most honorable and the most joyous sides of human nature in sport.</li>

                    <li><strong>Player Minimums</strong> - USAU College Series Events set specific player minimum requirements for as defined below:
                        <ul class="disc">
                            <li><strong>Registration Minimums:</strong> Whether a team can officially register for an event. For Series Events: 10 players</li>

                            <li><strong>Competition Minimums:</strong> Whether a team can continue to compete safely at an event. For Series Events: 7 players to start, 6 to continue playing. Fewer than 6 is a forfeit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li id="conference-championships"><strong>Conference Championships</strong>

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li><strong>Conference Participation</strong> -- Any team may participate in Conference Championships provided they have met the team and player requirements for participation. There is no additional qualifying process for the first level of the USA Ultimate College Series.</li>

                            <li><strong>Conference Assignment</strong> -- Teams will be <a href="https://usaultimate.org/college/guidelines-and-registration/college-sections/" target="window">placed into one of three types of Conferences</a>: D-I Conference, D-III Conference (limited to schools with &lt;7500 enrollment), or a Developmental Conference (limited to 2nd/3rd/etc teams from a given school; see v. below for potential exception).

                                <ol class="lower-numeral">
                                    <li>In Regions without D-III Conferences (i.e. regions with just one D-III team), the D-III teams in that region will be placed into the appropriate D-I Conference. D-III teams that earned their Region's bid to D-III Nationals may still participate in the D-I Conference event, however if they earn a bid to D-I Regionals, they will need to decide at that time whether they will take either the D-I Regionals bid or D-III Nationals bid.</li>

                                    <li>In Regions without Developmental Conferences, the Developmental teams in that region will be placed into the appropriate D-I or D-III (if available) Conferences, depending on the size of the school they are from.</li>

                                    <li>Developmental Conferences events will be determined between the March 3 roster deadline and the March 27 team registration deadline.</li>

                                    <li>D-III Conference schools that have qualified for the D-I College Championships in any of the prior 4 years will be placed into a D-I Conference by default and thus, in regions where there are D-III Conferences, will not be eligible for the D-III postseason. Those schools may apply by March 3, 2023 to stay in a D-III Conference if that is their preference. In the case where a D-III school has their 1st team in a D-I Conference, the 2nd team from a school may apply (by March 3, 2023) to be placed into a D-III Conference instead of a Developmental Conference. To apply, email your request to <a href="mailto:ben@hq.usaultimate.org">ben@hq.usaultimate.org</a>.</li>

                                    <li>Notwithstanding section iii above, a D-III team can choose to participate at their D-I conference championship event if they have participated at their D-I regional championship for each of the previous three years. To apply to be placed into a D-I conference, the team must apply before the beginning of the college regular season.

For example, a Conference with 4 bids and a Conference with 2 bids will compare their 5th and 3rd ranked teams, respectively, for a Team strength bid.</li>

Teams that elect a certain pathway cannot change pathways after their election has been made. Therefore, if a team elects the Division I pathway but does not perform well enough at their Division III Conference Championships to earn a bid to Division I Regionals, they cannot then opt for Division III Regionals. Teams that elect the Division I pathway who do not perform well enough at their Conference Championships to earn a bid to Division I Regionals still have the opportunity to improve their position for a waitlist bid based on their overall performance at their Conference Championship event.</li>

The Team Strength waitlist is the ordered list of conferences beyond the original number of bids allocated, based on the ranking of their "next best teams", according to the Team Strength process.

                            <li><strong>Attendance deadlines</strong> -- For the purposes of tournament logistics, Regional Directors and Tournament Directors may impose a deadline by which teams must decide whether they will attend the tournament. This deadline may be associated with submission of a tournament entry fee, as determined by the coordinator. Tournament Directors may keep entry fees from teams that pull out of the tournament beyond a certain date, provided that date (it cannot be before the USA Ultimate registration deadline, for instance) and the fee are reasonable, were approved by the event's USA Ultimate coordinator, and were communicated by the TD or coordinator to the teams ahead of time (coordinators are to put the approved deadline on the event's Score Reporting Tool page).

                                    <li><strong>Automatic bids</strong> - One automatic bid will be awarded to each Region. If there are no teams in a region that meet the minimum requirements to be included in the rankings, their geographic bid will be added to the team strength bid process.</li>

                                    <li>All players participating in the USA Ultimate College Championship tournaments (both D-I and D-III) for a given team must wear jerseys of identical color and design.</li>

                                    <li>Teams must have two jerseys of distinctly different color, one predominantly white and one predominantly dark. A jersey that is not white does not automatically qualify as a dark. Any color that may be described as light does not qualify as a dark jersey (e.g. yellow, pink, light blue, etc.).</li>

                                    <li>Jerseys must have numbers on the back and front of the jersey. The numbers on the back must be at least six inches high, be one or two digit Arabic numerals, be solid and in clear contrast with the jersey. Numbers on the front of the jersey must be at least four inches high, be located above the waist and clearly visible if tucked in. The front of the jersey is anything on the chest or abdomen; numbers on the front of sleeves do not fulfill this requirement. No two players on a given team may use the same number or numbers with the same value (e.g. 00 and 0, 01 and 1, etc.).</li>

                                    <li>Uniform bottoms (shorts, pants, skirts) worn by players on the field must be of identical color and design. Teams are not required to have numbers on their uniform bottoms, however if teams do opt to include numbers, they must be on the front left or right leg of their uniform bottoms (shorts, pants, skirts), although teams may opt to do both. The placement must be the same for the whole team. The numbers must be at least two inches high, match the number on the back of their jersey and be in visible contrast with the background material.</li>

                                    <li>Uniform accessories including tights, undershirts, compression sleeves and hats must be either solid black or coordinated with one team uniform color. Socks that are mid-calf or lower must be black, white or coordinating with one team color. Socks that sit above mid-calf must abide by the tights requirement.</li>

                                    <li>For broadcast games, USA Ultimate reserves the right to increase requirements to comply with broadcast partner standards and requirements. In light of this potential, it is recommended that teams and players prepare for the possibility of additional requirements, such as matching hats, socks and under-layers.</li>

                                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disqualify and/or fine players who fail to meet the uniform requirements.</li>

                    <li><strong>Formats</strong> - Conference Championship and Regional Championship tournament formats will be determined by coordinators using guidelines in the USA Ultimate Formats (updated in March 2023)</li>

                    <li><strong>Seeding</strong>

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>Seeding for Conference Championships, Regionals, USA Ultimate Division I College Championships, and USA Ultimate Division III College Championships will be done by the coordinator using the following information: input solicited from all the captains of participating teams, sanctioned results (e.g. rankings algorithm, head to head, common opponents, tournament finish), results of last year's Series, and other applicable information (e.g. team composition, conditions). The coordinator has the authority to adjust seeding according to the best information available.</li>

                            <li>Seeding for Regionals will additionally be held to the following guideline: No team that finishes ahead of another team at Conferences may be seeded behind that team at Regionals.</li>

                            <li>Seeding for the USA Ultimate Division I and Division III College Championships will additionally be held to the following guideline: The order of finish at Regionals will be strongly considered in determining seeding for Nationals, but will not be binding.</li>

                            <li>Seeding for Conference Championships must be pre-approved by the appropriate Regional Director. For Developmental Conferences without a coordinator, seedings are also pre-approved by the Regional Director.</li>

                            <li>Seeding for Regionals must be pre-approved by the National Director.</li>

                            <li>Seeding for the USA Ultimate Division I and Division III College Championships must be pre-approved by the Manager of College Competition and Athlete Programs.</li>

                            <li>For d. and e. above, If the Regional Director is affiliated (player, coach, alum, etc.) with a team participating in the event, seedings must be approved by the National Director. If the National Director is affiliated with a team participating in the event, seedings must be approved by the Manager of College Competition and Athlete Programs.</li>

                    <li><strong>Forfeit Rule (Series)</strong>

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>A team must play all of its games at a "qualifying" tournament in order to qualify for the next tournament in the Series. This includes all women's division teams in regions that meet the Regional Event Scaling guideline found in Section 4.a.i.</li>

                            <li>A team must start its first game in the Series with 7 players and play each point with at least 6 players.</li>

                            <li>A team that forfeits a Series game, and every player on that team's roster, is disqualified for the remainder of the current Series.</li>

                            <li> Any team that declines to finish a scheduled game or games, or attempts to decide a match by any manner other than playing ultimate on the field, will forfeit those games. Should both teams in a match choose not to play, then it will be considered a double forfeit.</li>

                            <li>At the discretion of the event's USAU coordinator, consideration may be given to situations that might warrant an exception being made, provided it does not affect the fairness or integrity of the competition.</li>

                            <li>Consideration should be given if a team misses the first game of the first day because of travel problems.</li>

                            <li>If one team is not ready to play at game-time, points may be assessed. Under these conditions, if the score of the game reaches 8-0, the team that has failed to signal readiness will technically forfeit the game.</li>

                            <li>A team will be considered to have forfeited any game where the number of players that can safely participate falls below the minimum requirement set by the competition minimums above.</li>

                            <li>The list of allowable forfeit scenarios is found in the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/formats-manual/" target="window">formats manual</a>.</li>

        <h3>IV. Violations and Sanctions</h3>

        <p>Failure to abide by any of the College Guidelines may result in sanctions on individuals or teams by the College Working Group, or through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of the guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competition. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the College Season, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition, and because it is often difficult to determine intent, <strong>guideline violations will result in serious repercussions.</strong> Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully, follow the guidelines carefully and avoid intended or unintended violations in the future.</p>
