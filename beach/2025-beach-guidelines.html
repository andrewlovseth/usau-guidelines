        <h3>I. Overview</h3>

        <p>The goal of the USA Ultimate Beach Division is to provide national level competition for players in the sand. USA Ultimate will host one event in 2025: the Beach Championships, which will be held in Virginia Beach, VA, on May 10-11. The guidelines that follow are USA Ultimate's requirements for qualification and criteria for acceptance for this year's event.</p>

        <p>In order to award bids early enough so that teams can prepare and finalize their teams, and so that organizers can make the necessary preparations, there will be a registration period during which the minimum number of teams (six per division) must register in order to automatically include the division in the event.</p>

        <p>With the goal of growing the amount of beach/sand play and building a connected local and national infrastructure, USA Ultimate will be rewarding communities that provide local playing opportunities to members, and, in so doing, encouraging communities to offer those playing opportunities going forward. Bids will be considered, giving decreasing preference to the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>USA Ultimate affiliate with beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>USA Ultimate affiliate without beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations with USA Ultimate-sanctioned beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Applicant teams with history of USA Ultimate-sanctioned beach/sand participation;</li>
            <li>Applicant teams with history of beach/sand participation;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations with unsanctioned beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations without beach/sand activity; and</li>
            <li>Applicant teams without history of beach/sand participation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Applicants will be asked to specify under which of the eight categories they are applying. A current list of USA Ultimate affiliates can be found <a href="https://usaultimate.org/affiliate-program/">here</a>. Along with the above, teams will be selected with emphasis being placed on geographic distribution and team strength.</p>

        <p>For 2025 the following changes will be in effect (with further details below):</p>

        <ul>
            <li>USA Ultimate will be discounting both Women's and the new U20 Mixed divisions.</li>
            <li>The U20 Mixed division will play 4v4 on a smaller field.</li>
            <li>Lower age requirements for Great Grand Masters athletes.</li>
            <li>With an earlier roster deadline this year, there will be an opportunity for teams to review rosters and give feedback for seeding.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Team Registration Deadline: Team must submit the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BeachNats25" target="blank">online application</a> (a pdf of the application can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/egadm0o6d4tmi2qia3uoy/BeachChamps25-App-Survey-preview.pdf?rlkey=0hcd72cyzheunu24cd9lbn2wg&st=7jirhkbg&dl=0" target="blank">here</a>) by February 9, midnight mountain time to USA Ultimate headquarters. For a division to be held, at least six teams must register by the Team Registration Deadline. <em>Note: Registration does require the submission of a partial roster on the application of at least five players.</em></li>

            <li>
                Team Confirmations will be sent out by February 24.

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Confirmed teams <strong>must have 10 current members</strong> rostered (all teams in mixed divisions must have at least five man-matching and five woman-matching position players rostered) <strong>by March 12</strong> and <strong>player fees paid by March 15</strong>.</li>

                    <p><em>Note: Acknowledging that not all players' gender identity may align with their sex assigned at birth, we will be using the terms “man-matching” and “woman-matching” in reference to on-field personnel matchups in all mixed divisions.</em></p>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li id="final-roster-deadline">Final Roster Deadline: April 21, 5pm MST - Teams will have until this date to add players to their roster, and submit team info form and pay player fees.</li>

        </ol>

        <h4 id="team-requirements" style="padding-top: 2rem">Team Requirements</h4>

        <p>There will be twelve potential divisions in the Beach Season: U20 (Under twenty) mixed, men's, mixed, women's, masters men's, masters mixed, masters women's, grand masters men's, grand masters mixed, grand masters women's and great grand masters men's, great grand masters women's.</p>

        <p>Historically there has been greater interest in the Beach mixed divisions than the beach men's and women's divisions including their various masters levels. To further encourage the formation of teams for the non-mixed divisions, geographic requirements will be relaxed for those divisions only. U20 Mixed will have its own requirements in this inaugural year. See 7.b. below, “Geographic Requirements.”</p>

                <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>
                <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

                <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount. Teams are expected to have a spirit captain, a player that has been designated by their team to address, discuss and resolve spirit-related issues at any point throughout the competition with opponents, teammates, coaches and event officials. Spirit captains should do spirit scoring with their teams after each game and are responsible for the timely submission of spirit scores.</p>

                <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

                <h4 id="uniform-guidelines">Name/Logo Uniform Guidelines</h4>
                <p>USA Ultimate reserves the right to alter, or require a team to alter, a team name, player nickname, team logo, jersey graphic or uniform, and/or suggest alternatives at, or in conjunction with, a USA Ultimate program or event should USA Ultimate personnel determine the existing name, logo, graphic or uniform might hinder the mission of the organization or the goals of a specific USA Ultimate program or event. <strong>This includes, but is not limited to, sexual references, profanity, drug references, and any discriminatory language or graphics.</strong> Alteration must meet the approval of USA Ultimate personnel.</p>

                <h4 id="uniform-requirements">Uniform Requirements</h4>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>All players participating in the USA Ultimate Beach Championships for a given team must wear jerseys of identical color and design.</li>

                    <li>Teams must have two jerseys of distinctly different colors, one predominantly white and one predominantly dark. A jersey that is not white does not automatically qualify as a dark. Any color that may be described as light does not qualify as a dark jersey (e.g. yellow, light gray, light pink, light blue).</li>

                    <li>Jerseys must have numbers on the back of the jersey. The numbers on the back must be at least six inches high, be one- or two-digit Arabic numerals, be solid and be in clear contrast with the jersey. No two players on a given team may use the same number or numbers with the same value (e.g. 00 and 0, 01 and 1). <em>It is recommended that jerseys have numbers on both the front and back of the jersey.</em></li>

                    <li>Uniform bottoms worn by players on the field must be of identical color and design. Teams are not required to have numbers on their uniform bottoms. However, if teams do opt to include numbers they must be on the front left or right leg of their shorts, although teams may opt to do both. The placement must be the same for the whole team. The numbers must be at least two inches high, match the number on the back of their jersey and be in visible contrast with the jersey.</li>

                    <li>It is recommended that uniform accessories, including tights, undershirts, hats and socks, be identical or coordinated in style and color.</li>

                    <li>Shoes or cleats are not permitted.</li>

                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disqualify and/or fine players who fail to meet the uniform requirements.</li>

                <h4 id="violations-and-sactions">Violations and Sanctions</h4>
                <p>
                    Failure to abide by any of the above guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or on individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of these guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competitions. In order to help teams follow Beach Division Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Beach Division. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for understanding and following Beach Division information and procedures. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the Beach Season, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition and because
                    it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully (or ask questions for clarification), follow the guidelines carefully and avoid violations.

                <p>In their USA Ultimate membership account, every athlete should select the gender identity option that best aligns with their gender identity. Athletes should select to participate in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe based on their indicated gender identity.</p>

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Players who select Man (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in men's/boys' divisions or as a man-matching player in mixed divisions.</li>

                    <li>Players who select Woman (cis or trans) as their gender identity option are eligible to compete in men's/boys' or women's/girls' divisions, or as a woman-matching player in mixed divisions.</li>

                    <li>
                        Players who select the Non-Binary or Prefer to Self-Report gender identity option are eligible to compete in the division in which they feel most comfortable and safe, as per USA Ultimate's Gender Inclusion Policy (approved 11.2020). <em><strong>Note:</strong> For those who select Prefer to Self-Report, there will be a fill-in option to provide any additional information regarding your gender identity. This is for internal educational purposes only and will not be shared.</em>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>
                        The personnel ratio <strong><em>on the field</em></strong> at all times for the mixed divisions will be 3/2 (three man-matching players and two woman-matching players, or three woman-matching players and two man-matching players).

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>The U20 Mixed division will be playing 2/2 rather than 3/2.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).</li>

                    <li>
                        Each point, a player representing the gender match-up with three players on the field must pull for that point. That is, if there are three women-matching players a woman-matching player must pull.

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>For the U20 Mixed division (4v4), the first pull is thrown by a woman-matching player, the second and third by man-matching players, the fourth and fifth by woman-matching players, and so on.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If a team cannot match the entire five-player personnel ratio of the opposing team, then it must play with fewer than five players, matching the personnel with as many players as possible, subject to Team Player Minimum Requirements above.

                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>For the U20 Mixed division, if a team cannot match the entire four-player personnel ratio of the opposing team, then the team forfeits the game, per Team Player Minimum Requirements above.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the majority pull rule will be handled the same as an offsides violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling “offsides,” the offense should call “majority pull violation.” Like with offsides violations, after the first majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as described in 9.B.4.d.2. Majority pull rule violations accumulate separately from offsides/false start violations. In games with observers, either the observer or a player on the field may call the violation.</li>

                    <li>
                        Substitutions: Player substitutions can be completed only:

                            <li>after a goal and before the substituting team has signaled readiness; or</li>

                            <li>to replace injured players, replace players with illegal equipment, or to resolve an incorrect personnel violation. In this case, the opposing team may substitute a like number of, or fewer, players. In the Mixed Division the substituting players must be of the same gender match.</li>

        <h4 id="u20-mixed-eligibility-goal">Beach Championships Player Eligibility Goal</h4>

        <p>To include as many players as possible who are in 12th grade and below, while maintaining consistent cutoffs that allow for fair competition. We extend this invite to players who have just graduated High School in the past several months and have not yet started competing with college teams. We do not want student athletes to feel obligated to make disadvantageous academic decisions to play youth ultimate. We recognize that school/educational options are increasing, including homeschooling, non-traditional schools, small private schools, and dual HS/college enrollment. (commonly HS Seniors turn 18 during their academic year).</p>

        <p>Participation in Beach Championships by athletes who have not yet graduated high school will NOT impact their college eligibility.</p>

        <p>Recent high school graduates can also participate in the U20 Mixed Division (4v4) without impacting their college eligibility. Participation in any other division at the Beach Championships will impact college eligibility.</p>

        <h4 id="u20-mixed-player-requirements">Player Requirements</h4>

        <ol class="numeric">
            <li>Players must be students currently enrolled in high school, middle school, or junior high. Recent high school graduates are permitted if they have graduated (or received a GED) within the last 12 months prior to May 11, 2025.</li>

            <li>No player can currently or previously have played college ultimate; rostered as practicing with team or competed at a sanctioned event.</li>

            <li>Each player on the roster must be a USA Ultimate member in good standing at all times during the event. Players may not use Affiliate Membership or pay one-time event fees for YCC.</li>

            <li>No player may be listed on two or more rosters at the same event (including across multiple gender or age divisions).</li>

            <li>Players under the age of 18 must have a completed Medical Authorization Form onsite at the event with their coach or chaperone.</li>

            <li>To be eligible for the U20 Mixed Division, players must not turn 20 prior to January 1, 2026 and be at least 14 years old at the time of the event.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Application and compliance of the above guidelines will be subject to the discretion of the USA Ultimate Competition staff.</em></p>

        <h4 id="u20-mixed-competition-guidelines">Competition Guidelines</h4>

        <p>
            <strong>Minor (Under 18) Player Info</strong><br />
            Minors must have a <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/medical-authorization-form/">Medical Authorization Form</a> completed prior to participation. A team with minors on it must have two or more approved, background-checked Chaperones listed on the team's official roster.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The medical release form is the responsibility of the chaperone; it must be brought to USA Ultimate Beach Championships and kept on hand by a rostered chaperone.</strong> This form will allow medical personnel to treat an injured minor without a parent/guardian having to be present. Without this form, a doctor might not be able to treat an injured minor.</p>

        <p>
            <em><strong>Note:</strong> A Medical Authorization is not the same as the USA Ultimate liability waiver or infectious disease waiver.</em>
        </p>

        <h4 id="u20-mixed-coaching-requirements">Coaching Certification Requirements</h4>

        <ul class="disc">
            <li>Each team must have one rostered coach with USA Ultimate High School or Middle School Coaching Certification (this is in addition to the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/coaches/become-a-coach/">Foundational Coach requirements</a>).</li>

            <li>All other coaches must be rostered, which means that they have completed the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/coaches/become-a-coach/">Foundational Coach requirements</a>.</li>
        </ul>
