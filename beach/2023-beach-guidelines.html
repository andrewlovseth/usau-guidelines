        <h3>I. Overview</h3>

        <p>The goal of the USA Ultimate Beach Division is to provide national level competition for players in the sand. USA Ultimate will host one event in 2023: the Beach Championships, which will be held in Huntington Beach, CA, on May 13-14. The guidelines that follow are USA Ultimate's requirements for qualification and criteria for acceptance for this year's event.</p>

        <p>In order to award bids early enough so that teams can prepare and finalize their teams, and so that organizers can make the necessary preparations, there will be a registration period during which the minimum number of teams (six per division) must register in order to include the division in the event. </p>

        <p>With the goal of growing the amount of beach/sand play and building a connected local and national infrastructure, USA Ultimate will be rewarding communities that provide local playing opportunities to members, and, in so doing, encouraging communities to offer those playing opportunities going forward. Bids will be considered, giving decreasing preference to the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>USA Ultimate affiliate with beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>USA Ultimate affiliate without beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations with USA Ultimate-sanctioned beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Applicant teams with history of USA Ultimate-sanctioned beach/sand participation;</li>
            <li>Applicant teams with history of beach/sand participation;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations with unsanctioned beach/sand activity;</li>
            <li>Unaffiliated organizations without beach/sand activity; and</li>
            <li>Applicant teams without history of beach/sand participation.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Applicants will be asked to specify under which of the eight categories they are applying. A current list of USA Ultimate affiliates can be found here. Along with the above, teams will be selected with emphasis being placed on geographic distribution and team strength. </p>

        <p>For 2023 the following changes will be in effect (with further details below): </p>

        <ul>
            <li>USA Ultimate will be adding two new divisions: Great Grand Masters Women's and Grand Masters Mixed.</li>
            <li>Out of region player allowances will be slightly higher for all non-mixed division</li>
            <li>For all mixed divisions, whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group must pull.</li>
        </ul>

For a division to be held, at least six teams must register by the Team Registration Deadline. <em>Note: Registration does require the submission of a partial roster on the application of at least five players.</em></li>

            <li>
                Team Confirmations will be sent out by February 24.

                <ul class="disc">
                    <li>Confirmed teams <strong>must have 10 current members</strong> rostered (all teams in mixed divisions must have at least five man-matching and five woman-matching position players rostered) and <strong>player fees paid by March 13</strong>.</li>

                    <p><em>Note: Acknowledging that not all players' gender identity may align with their sex assigned at birth, we will be using the terms “man-matching” and “woman-matching” in reference to on-field personnel matchups in all mixed divisions.</em></p>

        <p>There will be eleven potential divisions in the Beach Season: men's, mixed, women's, masters men's, masters mixed, masters women's, grand masters men's, grand masters mixed, grand masters women's and great grand masters men's, great grand masters women's.</p>
        
        <p>Historically there has been greater interest in the Beach mixed divisions than the beach men's and women's divisions including their various masters levels.  To further encourage the formation of teams for the non-mixed divisions, geographic requirements will be relaxed for those divisions only.  See 7.b. below, “Geographic Requirements.”</p>

                <h4 id="sotg">Spirit of the Game</h4>
                <p>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules or the basic joy of play.</p>

                <p>All players are responsible for knowing, administering and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount.</p>

                <p>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.</p>

However, if teams do opt to include numbers they must be on the front left or right leg of their shorts, although teams may opt to do both. The placement must be the same for the whole team. The numbers must be at least two inches high, match the number on the back of their jersey and be in visible contrast with the jersey. </li>
                    <li>It is recommended that uniform accessories, including tights, undershirts, hats and socks, be identical or coordinated in style and color.</li>
                    <li>Shoes or cleats are not permitted.</li>
                    <li>USA Ultimate reserves the right to disqualify and/or fine players who fail to meet the uniform requirements.</li>

                <h4 id="violations-and-sactions">Violations and Sanctions</h4>
                <p>Failure to abide by any of the above guidelines may result in sanctions through the USA Ultimate conduct process. Such sanctions may be imposed on a team or on individuals associated with a team deemed to be in violation of these guidelines, and may include, but are not limited to, suspension or disqualification from USA Ultimate competitions. In order to help teams follow Beach Division Guidelines and avoid violations, USA Ultimate will continue to work to improve registration procedures and communication of information pertaining to the USA Ultimate Beach Division. As these improvements are made by the organization, teams will continue to be held more fully responsible for understanding and following Beach Division information and procedures. Because consistency in holding all participants to the same administrative and competitive standards is vital to the integrity of the Beach Season, because many violations lead to unfair advantages in competition and because it is often difficult to determine intent, guideline violations will result in serious repercussions. Such repercussions will provide an incentive for players and teams to understand the guidelines fully (or ask questions for clarification), follow the guidelines carefully and avoid violations.</p>

                <p>On-field personnel ratio rules for the mixed divisions are described below in the On-field Personnel Ratio for Mixed Divisions section.</p>

                <p>Teams that are found to have violated the letter or spirit of these rules or whose behavior undermines the competition structure (e.g. misrepresenting the composition of a team at a specific event, misrepresenting the composition of a team over the course of the season, intentionally playing with ineligible players) will be subject to ramifications as outlined in “Violations and Sanctions.” Roster violations should be reported to <a href="mailto:david.raflo@hq.usaultimate.org">david.raflo@hq.usaultimate.org.</a></p>

                <h4 id="ratio">On-field Personnel Ratio for Mixed Division</h4>

                <ol class="numeric">
                    <li>The personnel ratio <strong><em>on the field</em></strong> at all times for the mixed divisions will be 3/2 (three man-matching players and two woman-matching players, or three woman-matching players and two man-matching players).</li>

                    <li>At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc flip happens with the winner selecting the personnel ratio for the first point. For the second and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two points repeats until the end of the game (half time has no impact on the pattern).</li>

                    <li>Whichever gender-matching players have the majority on the starting line, a player of that gender-matching group must pull. For example, if there are 3 woman-matching players and 2 man-matching players on the line that is pulling, one of their woman-matching players must pull the disc to start the point and vice versa.</li>

                    <li>If a team cannot match the entire five-player personnel ratio of the opposing team, then it must play with fewer than five players, matching the personnel  with as many players as possible.</li>

                    <li>
                        Injury timeouts:
                        <ol class="lower-alpha">
                            <li>In the event of an injury timeout where a player leaves the field, the replacing player must maintain the same personnel ratio  as was with the injured player.</li>

                            <li>If a team replaces players, the opposing team has the option of substituting a like number of, or fewer, players.</li>

                            <li>The replacing player must maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the player they replace.</li>

                            <li>If a team calls an injury timeout but does not have a replacement player to maintain the same personnel ratio as was with the injured player, it may not replace that player and must play with fewer than five players.</li>
